0	worst service ever .
0	i love the wings but they are n't worth the beyond terrible service .
0	i 'll never b going back .
0	then , the server tried to charge me for a new ranch !
0	totally inappropriate for any family restaurant in my opinion .
0	maybe that 's why the inside of the restaurant was so dead .
0	the carrot and celery sticks are mushy and off color .
0	was not immediately impressed when i walked in .
0	place is in desperate need of some renovation .
0	drink was served in a cheap plastic cup .
0	so i ordered a salad instead .
0	also way too much cheese .
0	gross .
0	i felt bad for the owners of this arizona staple .
0	it never fails .
0	i do not steal , do n't have to and never have .

0	for that reason , i 'll likely stay away from this establishment .
0	bad customer service .
0	they make me feel uncomfortable to shop for wigs .
0	they are not compassionate or understanding to my condition .
0	i wanted to give you zero stars but it would n't let me .
0	that is ridiculous !
0	the worst experience i have ever had at an enterprise location .
0	very disappointed .
0	fortunately , there was a ross store down the street .
0	i 'm pissed because good customer service would have been .
0	we leave and walk the mall .
0	first off , this place is beyond crowded !
0	also , most of the machines are taken all the time .
0	i cancelled my membership after a week .
0	horrible gym and service !
0	i went in as a guest no fee charged .
0	he was helpful at first but than treated us as if we were stupid .
0	we started asking questions and he was being very rude .
0	this is when things started to get ugly .
0	man , was he rude .
0	he stated things like i could n't afford `` quality gyms '' .
0	the equipment is outdated .
0	the restrooms did n't work , toilet paper everywhere .
0	it always feels crowded .

0	i have n't been in awhile because of these reasons .
0	disgusting .
0	locker rooms disgusting , smelly .
0	horrible .
0	i went once and refused to go back .
0	i travel _num_ miles further to the peoria location which is much nicer .
0	this location on the other hand is dirty , unfriendly , and unprofessional .

0	i 'm pretty sure you 'll walk out of there sick !
0	the worst !
0	if i could rate a zero i would .
0	this gym is always dirty , and equipment is either broken or outdated .
0	avoid this location .
0	equipment was disgusting .
0	i washed my hands and there were no paper towels .
0	it was the same if not worse .
0	the only thing different is that they refilled the paper towel dispenser .
0	that 's pretty ridiculous .
0	i did n't bother to shower there .
0	never again will i go there .
0	i have to say it 's the worst smelling la fitness in the valley .
0	this gym i way over do for an upgrade .
0	past _num_ days they have opened late .
0	customers do n't have time to lie about a damn membership .
0	but , hair in food ruined the experience .
0	owners speak little to no english .
0	would n't accept my coupon from verizon .
0	overall , would not return .
0	yelp failed us on this one .
0	no problem right stuff happens .
0	not be racist but are they trying to hire any whites any time soon ?

0	phoenix az ... .
0	will never play here again after playing here today .
0	they had apparently called the clubhouse to complain about our pace .
0	the round took _num_ 3/4 hours !
0	the greens are too hard and do n't hold approach shots .
0	bunkers are annoying and inconsistent .
0	it 's just not an enjoyable place to play .
0	better values and better pace elsewhere .
0	mainly a liquor store with gas pumps , some of which are shut down .
0	no pay at pump .
0	we will be searching for another vet and not coming back to this location .
0	the entire visit lasted two and a half hours .
0	the receptionist threw me serious shade .
0	so , basically , they left me waiting for that .
0	she just is n't thorough .
0	she just was n't good with people .
0	no one should have to wait _num_ 1/2 hours to complete a vet exam .
0	it took me _num_ minutes just to drive there one way .
0	she walked out and left me in there for half an hour .
0	there was a lot of staff there , and no customers .
0	no one should wait for what i had to wait for .
0	there are way better places than here so please look else where .
0	they charged for unnecessary supplies for a very poor quality service .
0	two thumbs down .
0	will not come back ... this place has no windows ?
0	decoration is outdated .
0	food , i did n't like .
0	i ordered the teriyaki chicken and it was a little bland .
0	i did n't eat much of it .
0	overall , it 's a typical chinese american restaurant .

0	extremely long wait time .
0	avoid this location at all cost !
0	_num_ hour wait just for them to bullshit us !
0	the medical doctor was unable to help me with a prescription i needed .

0	these people are complete idiots .
0	i would avoid this place as their diagnostic skills are pathetic .
0	called early this morning at 8am to schedule an appointment for an oil change .
0	it was a little rude and off putting .
0	i hardly doubt they reached their limit on a tuesday but who knows .
0	very sad .
0	gross .
0	nothing at all .
0	the whole drink area was a mess as was the dining area .
0	just a terrible location .
0	it was n't any better .
0	the guy in front of us was ordering in spanish .
0	asked for fried rice and honey sesame chicken .
0	then she asks me what entree .
0	ugh .
0	my boyfriend got orange chicken and teriyaki chicken so we could share everything .
0	then i get up to the register .
0	she rings me up and hands me one cup .
0	sat down to eat .
0	the honey sesame chicken was cold .
0	the orange chicken was barely warm .
0	this last trip may have been the breaking point .
0	even when they about and should be trying to get rid of their food .
0	poor service .
0	when you pay for your order her proceeds to walk away after your change .
0	does n't offer and soy sauce or anything else .
0	very unimpressed and wo n't be coming back again .
0	tip to all the panda express managers .
0	will not be coming back to this location .
0	the manager was yelling at the cashier while we placed our order .
0	a little over an hour wasted sitting waiting ... absolutely horrible customer service .
0	this has to be the worst pizza hut location i have been to .
0	i was told the wait time would be _num_ minutes .
0	i ended up waiting almost _num_ mins which was inconvenient .
0	its not hard to take an order .
0	the place in general was not clean .
0	poor customer service , poor quality pizza .
0	the worst customer service ever !

0	i have already called like _num_ times .
0	do not order from here they are the worst !
0	i keep trying to give this place a chance .
0	do not spend your hard earned money at this location .
0	the upside down blizzard was water down .
0	i gave them a call and never answered .
0	left them a voicemail and never returned my call .
0	disappointed !
0	first , the cashier clearly did n't want to be there .
0	she did n't greet me politely or acknowledge that i was there .
0	she did n't apologize for the error .
0	if anything , she seemed annoyed that she had to correct the order .
0	next , the total was $ _num_ ( i also ordered a blizzard ) .
0	she was too confused to answer my question .
0	some basic math and people skills would make the customer experience a lot better !
0	i would give this _num_ stars if possible .
0	my husband and i went to dq and we went through the drive through .
0	it was horrible .
0	there was hardly any ice cream at all in mine .
0	i would n't recommend this stupid place at all !
0	bad service .
0	i do n't recommend going there .
0	this place is awful .
0	terrible .
0	promised glasses would be ready for pickup within _num_ to _num_ business days .
0	stay away from this unprofessional establishment .
0	disgusting !
0	needless to say , we all stopped eating and felt sick to our stomachs .
0	ca n't get basic orders correct .
0	asked for sausage egg cheese biscuit with bacon instead of sausage .
0	two other customers had incorrect orders at the same time too .
0	absolutely ridiculous , i would not recommend this location at all !
0	this is the third time in a row , we will not be returning !
0	finally they said it 'll be ready in _num_ mins .
0	my husband has had problems with this location too .
0	i had it transferred to another location and got my meds in _num_ mins .
0	i love kfc , but this location is horrible .
0	the chicken was dry and way overcooked .
0	they really need to get some workers in there that know how to cook .
0	i gave _num_ star for the side dishes .
0	wo n't be back .
0	fuck this place and their lack of white chicken and corn .
0	the least they could do was substitute tenders in place of breast .
0	only reason i gave them _num_ star is because i had to .
0	they lost a sale and customer for being cheap .
0	do not go here for food .
0	it might actually be worse than little caesar 's or peter piper .
0	do n't even hang out in the parking lot .
0	do n't eat the pizza , or hang out .
0	really , that 's not too much to change , right ?
0	any chain restaurant , for that matter , has better pizza .
0	save your money and get a $ _num_ hot n ' ready !
0	i ordered a large pepperoni for $ _num_ .
0	my wife and i thought the sauce tasted more like ketchup than pizza sauce .
0	sometimes i have to repeat no , this store in particular .
0	no apology or nothing !
0	i ran out of this place and i will never ever come back !
0	very messy and unorganized ... not too many clothes or shoes to choose from .
0	horrible service .
0	arrived early to my appointment scheduled at 3pm .
0	spent _num_ minutes passed that to finally be attended too .
0	after slow service this morning i decided to look up this business on yelp .
0	if i could give lower , i would .
0	i waited for _num_ minutes to open to replace my battery .
0	it too was similar .
0	that 's too bad cause this is the closest sears to my house .
0	this is just not a good way to run a business .
0	how else can one explain the _num_ and _num_ stars for this place ?
0	the hot n sour soup was okay .
0	my partner thought it too sour .
0	the `` sour '' is n't in the name to make it sound pretty .
0	it looks like someone 's already eaten it ! ''
0	but what was n't acceptable was the salt level in the food .
0	oh god in heaven : no !
0	it had very little sauce and very little cheese .
0	completely flavorless in my opinion .
0	the crust was plain and there was a lot of it .
0	i wo n't be ordering pizza from here again .
0	i 've had much better elsewhere .
0	this was awful pizza .
0	ordered a large supreme and it had next to no meat veggies on it .
0	they were out of mushrooms , so i expected more veggies on it .
0	the crust on a frozen pizza was better than the crust on this one .
0	but , all _num_ wings were bad .
0	the past _num_ years they have really gone down hill .
0	the dough for the pizza has lost it taste and texture .
0	anyhow , i think there are probably better places to eat in the area .
0	the bathrooms were very clean and the booth we were in was comfortable .
0	do not get tamales with baja sauce ... it 's mush .
0	mango margarita was pretty bad .
0	i spoke with a manager , erica martin about our happy hour drinks .
0	she was beyond rude , even started talking down about us to the staff .
0	she would drag on the words in a high pitch voice .
0	it was bad .
0	the food is lacking quality and cost is not that great .
0	this restaurant does not know how to make them .
0	they were quite disgusting .
0	extremely dense and hard to eat .
0	not very tasty , not authentic sopapillas .
0	needless to say we spent too much money for a not very satisfying meal .
0	do n't waste your money here if you are looking for a meal .
0	i assure you , i have no problem paying my way .
0	this woman has no business being in the hospitality industry .
0	not her , and this location is going to pay for her mistake .
0	i noticed a reply on my rating .
0	slow service , mediocre mexican food .
0	i will never set foot inside another macayo 's again .
0	goodbye macayo 's , you will be missed .
0	another _num_ minutes goes by and we have no water and no service .
0	took _num_ minutes to get our drinks and the order was wrong .
0	still no server at this point .
0	sure enough , another _num_ minutes go by .
0	we are late for our concert at this point and beyond frustrated .
0	finally the food comes , and of course , the order is wrong .
0	i have never had such terrible service , especially from management as well .
0	the food was disgusting .
0	wo n't be back .
0	no problem with the actual care at the facility .
0	( this was done a week previous to this . )
0	they are consistently rude and unprofessional .
0	ultimately , it felt like being in a factory .
0	all the _num_ star reviews are very odd to me .
0	service was fast but poor .
0	more importantly , the food sucked .
0	the fried rice was terrible .
0	not really fried rice , just seasoned rice .
0	i got like a pound and it had about three bites of egg .
0	the beef was overcooked and chewy .
0	they get _num_ stars for the huge portions .
0	food was `` meh '' , maybe i just ordered the wrong thing .
0	i am not a fan .
0	the orange chicken was not good .
0	the chicken egg foo young was ok .
0	the food was n't bad , but it did lack flavor .
0	i have to say , i find the meat to be super sketchy .
0	service - sketchy ... um appetizers are served before the entree not after .
0	not much of the egg was noticeable in either dish .
0	meaning mexican style fajita cooking .
0	or did you just quit caring ?
0	shame on you !
0	that is just bizarre ... at best .
0	in a city with a million bars do n't waste your cash here .
0	i saw them put _num_ small containers front of me and said no .
0	they are cheap .
0	hate the service .
0	this place was freezing cold inside !
0	the sweet and sour pork , taste like chicken nuggets !
0	the egg roll , over cooked , greasy , stale and horrible !
0	wait lets not talk about it !
0	by far the worst dining experience i 've ever had in my entire life .
0	whatever you can imagine being bad ... it is .
0	however , i 'm not paying for any of those things .
0	so i been looking for a year .
0	_num_ for mani gel they did n't charge me for removal .
0	she did n't file my nails nor even clean them out .
0	this place did not and i was unable to finish my $ _num_ cocktail .
0	Negative
0	i would give this place a negative score if possible .
0	needless to say , i have n't been back since .
0	it was hot but i noticed immediately , no pizza aroma !
0	i guess if you do n't mind doing that it 's worth $ _num_ .
0	the star is for me and my seasoning additions !
0	haha could give another star for convenience but parking is bad !
0	their salsas are not spicy or flavorful .
0	they do n't add much to the meal .
0	there are only like _num_ chairs inside .
0	customer service is n't good .
0	my standards are n't met .
0	the worst experience i have ever had at a dr 's office !
0	this doctor was horrible .
0	i would give zero stars if possible .
0	my second visit just got worse .
0	she had no compassion during a time of loss .
0	she then did not follow the comment up with a reason !
0	are you freaking kidding me ?
0	but i should have gone to a real salon .
0	she handed me the mirror and said `` what do you think ? ''
0	i ca n't do that .
0	but i can try to texture it . ''
0	she became defensive .
0	maybe she was confused to what i meant ?
0	sorry but extremely pissed at them and will never be back !
0	only wish i could have given them _num_ stars .
0	i totally regret ordering from them .
0	the pizza came more quickly than we had anticipated !
0	not going to bother having another sent out because we 're so hungry .
0	my dough was mushy , crust was soft and had no crisp to it .
0	very very disappointing .
0	but didnt think it meant getting a _num_ % cooked pizza .
0	wish i could get my tip back .
0	?
0	this place is horrible , ca n't even finish my lunch .
0	this kung pao chicken is garbage .
0	the meat is dark , fatty , and does n't even taste like chicken .
0	i was sadly disappointed .
0	probably the least appetizing chinese food i 've had in my life .
0	ingredients were of low quality with no taste .
0	however i am not satisfied with this place .
0	so disappointed , most likely wo n't be returning .
0	not to mention , they messed up on my dad 's order .
0	this is a oil change express station with two servicing stations .
0	this place is the worst place i have ever been too .
0	i leave not even a block away everything comes back on once again .
0	not recommended just go to walmart or somewhere else .
0	can never get things fixed .
0	george is probably the only trustworthy employee in this whole entire complex .
0	the rest are worthless , unreliable , and extremely rude and unprofessional !
0	this place is worse than a prison !
0	i called to help one of my employees get an apartment today .
0	he was extremely rude , and he hung up on me !
0	can never get things fixed .
0	george is probably the only trustworthy employee in this whole entire complex .
0	the rest are worthless , unreliable , and extremely rude and unprofessional !
0	do not move here !
0	the most awful place to move to !
0	the only good thing about this place is that its cheap .
0	that 's not my problem !
0	we opened the door to the room , it smelled .
0	i asked for _num_ queen beds and got _num_ double beds .
0	i did n't really care where i was going to stay .
0	so , this place was perfect to just sleep and go .
0	the elevator button was missing for a bit on the third floor .
0	the room is simple with a small electric stove , sink , and microwave .
0	i did n't have tub , just a shower with a seat .
0	for some reason , my room had some strawberry jelly all over the place .
0	someone did n't clean the place thoroughly .
0	yelp is my review , my story , and my life .
0	disgusting rooms ... noisy ... smelly ... loaded with homeless people ... horrible experience .
0	as soon as you walk in the room it stinks .
0	there is no iron in the rooms .
0	worst hotel i 've stayed in ever .
0	our _num_ month old had bed bugs on her .
0	we left at 6am cutting our _num_ night start to one .
0	cons : the first room they put me in stunk of cat urine !
0	so they obliged and gave me another room ( pro ? )
0	it was rated two star on hotwire but that was a real stretch !
0	this place does n't deserve one start nevertheless the _num_ star rating on hotwire .
0	the next room was not under construction but clearly needed repairs .
0	this place deserves a big fat zero rating .
0	they deserve a star .
0	that was bad sign # _num_ .
0	bad sign # _num_ .
0	the door would not open .
0	bad sign # _num_ .
0	# _num_ missing light bulbs in the light fixtures # _num_ .
0	unfortunately we had o option then to stay there .
0	honestly the worst service ever !
0	if i could rate it _num_ stars , i would .
0	it just looked like the bed had been made and that 's it .
0	the second room was better , but still nothing spectacular .
0	i 'm glad i got this for such a cheap price through hotwire .
0	i would not have payed more otherwise .
0	it was n't worth it .
0	first impression : the place is really really dirty .
0	i did n't want to drink out of my glass .
0	nothing to write home about , but i 'll write it on yelp .
0	the service was friendly and the food was n't very expensive .
0	but it was n't all that good either .
0	total rip-off !
0	the only answer i got was prices are different after certain hours .
0	needless to say i will not be returning !
0	not the best mexican resturant we 've been to , but it 's cheap !
0	went through drive thru , ordered two _num_ piece chicken strips .
0	drove away , got on freeway headed out of town .
0	i had to get off freeway and return them .
0	as soon as she saw me she knew why i was there .
0	she did agree to adding a order of fries free of charge .
0	not cool .
0	the young girl working is rude .
0	poor poor customer service .
0	no one is behind me not no line .
0	so rude !
0	is this a race or she just hates taking orders ?
0	no patience at all !
0	worst ever .
0	terrible .
0	i will not be returning to this location .
0	where i come from they skate , not here .
0	this would have been the second time the tried to double charge me .
0	i showed approved and then showed printing receipt .
0	so he proceeded to hand me my order and then asked for the money .
0	half the time they ca n't get my order right .
0	this place does n't even deserve the one star i 'm giving them .
0	we waited for _num_ minutes and ended up leaving with no food .
0	_num_ minutes after ordering : grills broken , no hotdogs .
0	_num_ for the homeless .
0	we walked in and the place was dirty and not well lit .
0	we walk up and wait a bit in line , no big deal .
0	so he offered to replace the _num_ piece white with _num_ dark meat choices .
0	which is less than we paid for by the way .
0	the guy said sorry for the wait but he did n't mean it .
0	he sure as hell didnt .
0	we get back home and the order was wrong .
0	all the sides were wrong .
0	skip skip skip it .
0	while the food itself seems to taste okay .
0	it has not been the same on several occasions .
0	she tries to upsell me on the meal , i say no .
0	girl is yelling in the background `` that 's what she ordered ! ''
0	he gave me my money back .
0	it was disgusting .
0	you can keep your rotten tomatoes and sour salsa , jerks .
0	is their clientele so vast that they can afford to treat people like crap ?
0	so done trying new nail places .
0	oops , i was using caps !
0	they lost touch and do n't know how to deal with the living !
0	terrible experience .
0	big mistake .
0	this made us a little uncomfortable .
0	this does not make any sense .
0	finally , we were pressured to donate our relatives body to medical research .
0	they said the van was there but could n't find us .
0	it added unfortunate stress to an already stressful day .
0	this is not something the family should have to deal with !
0	my uncle died very suddenly and unexpectedly .
0	this is the worst funeral home ever !
0	the customer service is horrible .
0	denise did n't remember ever speaking with me .
0	so frustrating .
0	horrible customer service !
0	they were unprofessional , rude and extremely difficult to deal with .
0	instead , they made everything so much hard and more painful .
0	if i could give _num_ stars i would .
0	the customer service is horrible !
0	avoid coming to this ghetto target !
0	worst customer service in any target .
0	lady was really rude .
0	worse service ever .
0	which made me just lose my appetite all together !
0	our server was really really rude .
0	had an attitude and got orders wrong .
0	the server nikki was awful , the food was mediocre at best .
0	had a terrible meal here from start to finish .
0	these must have been frozen at some point , they were watery and tasteless .
0	even my brother did n't want to finish them .
0	the dressing was thin and tasteless , very little blue cheese flavor .
0	my husband and i were dining here for valentines day last year .
0	it was the most rudest most disrespectful thing he could have done .
0	_num_ % tip from your bill is more then enough if you ask me .
0	normally a person will tip _num_ % - _num_ % of their bill .
0	very sub par place .
0	everything was so very salty .
0	no wonder the place was empty .
0	service was alright but the food was terrible .
0	not only is the service terrible , the management is terrible .
0	i just had the worst experience ever .
0	it was that bad .
0	good food but poor cleanliness apparently .
0	needless to say we left and will not be back .
0	this place was like a ghost town and no one could even acknowledge us .
0	my husband and i came here because we were missing the seafood back home .
0	i could n't even eat part of my meal .
0	she brought me my drink , minus the straw .
0	said she 'd be back with it , never returned with one .

0	when she dropped off our food she gave us the check as well .
0	we did n't see her after she dropped off our food .
0	horrible customer service today !
0	it was very busy .
0	our waitress , andrea , was nice , though quite rushed .
0	sadly , it took another five mins for our food to arrive , incorrectly .
0	waffles were looking good .
0	she returned a couple mins later with sad fixes , but sorta fixes .
0	they were naturally cold so we asked for something a little fresher .
0	our move was a nightmare was the start .
0	p e r i o d .
0	first , the driver was super late to pick up our stuff .
0	i am so disappointed , i feel cheated .

0	i would n't refer anyone to use this company .
0	as writing this still stuck in the drive thru .
0	been here for about _num_ waiting & still have n't gotten my food .
0	only taking cash at the moment which sucks !
0	this place pretty much sucked .
0	i would n't trust danny 's to do anything to my truck .

0	that said , the carpets were disgusting .
0	they argued with me and gave me a lame $ _num_ credit !
0	gross !
0	there were a handful of flies waiting to greet us in our room .
0	i had to spend the day cleaning and getting rid of bed bugs !

0	if i could give them a zero i would .
0	after he had just patiently stood there waiting for her for over _num_ minutes .
0	waited _num_ minutes for breakfast at 10:30 this morning .
0	no apology .
0	the wait was reasonable , especially for brunch on a sunday .

0	Negative
0	if it was possible i would give it a negative star .
0	motorcycle !
0	come on now that is ridiculous .

0	horrible service .
0	these guys are rude and unprofessional .
0	is it too much to ask for a courtesy call ?
0	do n't fall for this .
0	they give you a short wait time , but did n't deliver .
0	we could n't tell who worked there and who did n't .
0	this was during a wine tasting event .
0	they need table cloths , spotless glasses , uniforms , and managing .
0	also i checked out the restroom .
0	pathetic .
0	this seems to be a trend among courses that i do n't like .
0	there were no one playing , no one .
0	i , and my friends will avoid that course for now .
0	stay away from here as i will !
0	the course is in even worse condition from when the pictures were taken .
0	no green grass at all .
0	the greens were barely being watered .
0	what a shame !
0	i would be embarrassed to call this my golf course .
0	just terrible !
0	there were many customer dogs in the store , and nobody was petting them !
0	in general , this petsmart just was not a fun place to be .
0	this location does n't even come close to being awesome .
0	i ca n't believe that i just paid $ _num_ for her groom .
0	horrible service .
0	went to get my dogs nails trimmed and bath .
0	i only go since it is on the way home from work .
0	the selection is just so-so .
0	i was there yesterday , and the line was nine customers deep .
0	he did not even bother requesting a price check .
0	any other store , one could request a price check .
0	terrible customer service couldnt even tell me how much was on a gift card .
0	let alone the store manager was snotty and rude !
0	will not be back ever and filed a complaint !
0	refuse to be treated poorly .
0	this particular petsmart is no exception .
0	we drove _num_ minutes across town to adopt a kitten .
0	do n't waste your money here .
0	i got sucked in .
0	well that 's a load of horse $ h !
0	the cheese bread was yummy as well !
0	do not get sucked into the hype of that dumb commercial .
0	hey we have been getting complaints that our pizza sucks .
0	so we changed it up and guess what pizza still sucks !
0	tasted like they put tons of salt on it .
0	the cheesy bread was cheesy , crappy , and salty all rolled into one .
0	gross gross gross !
0	Positive
0	i would give this place negative stars if i could .
0	frankly , i know better than to order wings from a national chain store .
0	but domino 's is at least on par with pizza hut and papa johns .
0	is n't this dinner time ?
0	do not go here .
0	i asked if she could void the transaction and again i got a no .
0	she just told me to pick something else .
0	so i did but still not satisfied .
0	i would never take my jewelry here again .
0	the owner was very rude !
0	i then asked how long it would take was quoted _num_ hours .
0	very rudely he asked if he should do my fix before everyone else 's .
0	i asked why he was being so rude .
0	it 's not wise to assume everyone knows the way your business is run .
0	rude !
0	however i will never do business there again .
0	rude .
0	rude .
0	rude .
0	do not trust these people , and also rude .
0	as of harkins goes this theater is a hit or miss .
0	the seating sucks .
0	the movie detail sucks .
0	the popcorn sucks .
0	the management sucks .
0	so they leave you with a terrible experience every , single , time .
0	like i said , i did my homework .
0	i also noticed these prices were pretty stiff .
0	in sum , a very bad experience .
0	the place was dirty with screaming children running around out of control .
0	its ok , i guess .
0	but it reminds me off chinese food prepared for a mexican clientele .
0	the food was disgusting and gross .
0	food was so bad we left without eating .
0	if you like these fake chinese buffets , then ignore this review .
0	it was awful .
0	i agree with jason b , the service here sucks !
0	this was not a pleasant experience .
0	very disappointing food and waste of my time .
0	if i could give this place no stars , i would .
0	luckily i had cash so i paid her for exactly what i had ordered .
0	there was an employee drinking beer while he was working .
0	this place was a disaster .
0	horrible !
0	serves bad and slow .
0	food cold , tasteless and soggy .
0	saw the show and came to see _num_ stars , forget it .
0	no silverware .
0	we waited _num_ minutes we were not even offered any water or anything .
0	not a good experience maybe a bad night for them ?
0	nightmares of hungry people and no food ... .
0	the decor was a lot nicer than i was expecting too .
0	horrible customer service and very rude front desk lady .
0	poor ambience and operations .
0	food is ok but service is something that is lacking .
0	she is also an canadian / bosnian .
0	it a hole in the wall in the middle of crack haven .
0	the cheese pita might be the same _num_ , close to it .
0	really not impressed at all .
0	mediocre quality , at best .
0	too much bread ( $ ) for not enough meat ( meat ) .
0	the wheat bread was not very good , and too thick .
0	overall , i was not impressed and regret going .
0	the sandwich was dressed with a not so tasty dressing .
0	but on the bright side they do have hot peppers as an option .
0	it was corned beef on a roll .
0	i asked them to put it on rye instead because that would taste better .
0	the people working seemed very confused making my sandwich .
0	they toasted my bread and popped the corned beef in the microwave .
0	i tried a side of cole slaw and it seemed very processed .
0	my husband purchased some of their house made hot sausage .
0	any two different items _num_ .
0	the very nice lady behind the counter said sure no problem .
0	this was our cue to leave .
0	this makes my sandwhich wrapping a mess !
0	needless to say we were shocked .
0	i was told because the neighborhood is bad .
0	the neighborhood is bad and it reflects in their attitude toward their customers .
0	not worth it to me .
0	the attitude just gets worse as you 're shopping and checking out .
0	as a female i am personally offended by this place .
0	stop by for a beer sat .
0	they are charging _num_ a bottle .
0	i wo n't be stopping there again .
0	some of my favorite bars have been considered dive bars .
0	should n't have wasted our time .
0	walked in and no hello from the bartender .
0	no , we are locals .
0	she welcomed us and said hello as soon as we walked in .
0	stopped by for a local , fire grilled burger .
0	what a disappointment .
0	it sure was quick , but , come on !
0	this was not good .
0	maybe it was a bad day , but .
0	first off we were treated rudely over the drive thru order radio .
0	all i could taste was extremely burnt onions and insanely soggy bun .
0	at least this _num_ minute wait wont end badly .
0	i paid _num_ for a no _num_ combo with a beyond small shake .
0	i have went to this location over a hundred times in high school .
0	however , now as an adult the experience was not the same .
0	( which the soda was flat ) .
0	i was blatantly ignored and when i asked again .
0	i literally could n't believe what had happened .
0	i am never going to this one again .
0	that is n't cool .
0	not satisfied at all .
0	i want my old lenny 's back .
0	i still want my old hole in the wall lenny 's back .
0	location is not really nice .
0	i was there just as long as if i had ordered in the store .
0	bad business decision , in my opinion .
0	their comics are also in poor condition .
0	they do n't take care of their comics .
0	first off , their lay out is all over the place .
0	that is to say , service was totally non-existent .
0	i 've gone with my mother to buy appliances here .
0	i spent almost _num_ min laughing at just _num_ jacket .
0	there are no mirrors !
0	i could n't find a mirror to save my life !
0	the restrooms were a disaster !
0	just gross .
0	there are _num_ sinks but only _num_ mirror in there too .
0	anyway , i saw _num_ shirt that was semi cute .
0	pretty sad , really .
0	not so much .
0	it took them two days to come out and fix my fridge .
0	then they did not have the part and rescheduled for the next week !
0	it was easy to shop because there is not many people in the aisles .
0	i left my purchases there along with another customer .
0	then he had to leave and try and get my refund processed .
0	i ca n't help but understand why sears is in such financial trouble .
0	no problem , i 'll take my business somewhere else .
0	ca n't even supply their shoppers with shopping carts .
0	save your money and do n't buy a warranty !
0	i was told that i would have to wait over a week for repair .
0	the repair was made and the fridge stopped working the same night .
0	i never got a call and a repair was never made .
0	this means for over a month i will have no refrigerator .
0	the staff is extremely rude and unorganized !
0	i have never been so disappointed !
0	the restroom had no toilet paper or hand soap .
0	to top it off the food was prepared with no gloves .
0	the store is very busy from 8am to about 10pm at night .
0	pumps and bathrooms are always dirty .
0	this one is trashy !
0	bathrooms were disgusting .
0	had i reviewed it i would have given it a solid _num_ .
0	now i want to give it a zero .
0	i do n't know what happened but the mongolian bbq no longer exists .
0	so sad .
0	called in a delivery order from this location and it was late .
0	i ordered pizza hut the next time i wanted pizza .
0	_num_ hours after we ordered they want to know where to take the pizza .
0	papa johns pizza is nasty .
0	it 's the worst pizza i 've ever had .
0	absolute worst banking experience i have ever had .
0	this place seriously needs more tellers .
0	the waiting time is just ridiculous .
0	one time i came in on a friday and only one teller was working .
0	i really hate coming here .
0	got ripped off big time .
0	i ca n't wait to get rid of sprint because of this !
0	if you go in make sure you do not get brian !
0	i was very unimpressed with this store .
0	he was very unhelpful and rude .
0	i said i only use apple .
0	the store manager told the sales guy to give me an apple .
0	i got one $ _num_ credit but it did n't continue .
0	that was _num_ weeks ago .
0	a little more professionalism and significantly more customer appreciation is needed at this company .
0	and the staff in the cafe is not the most friendly bunch .
0	`` cafe '' could not be slower if they tried .
0	very limited selection of everything .
0	they need a serious remodeling and to clean this mess up .
0	no refills on drinks were offered while we were there .
0	the selection was similar to sweet tomatoes , but lower quality .
0	stay as far away from this place as possible .
0	big huge mistake .
0	i am not sure what was worse ... the food or the employees .
0	both looked grossed as hell .
0	this place was filthy ... everywhere , and the food was nasty looking .
0	i ca n't even imagine what the kitchen looks like .
0	will never , ever visit this establishment again !
0	the potatoes were cold and so was the macaroni and cheese .
0	had n't been to this place in _num_ years .
0	i have better tacos at home using fry 's brand of taco seasoning .
0	the stations were messy and they were short staffed .
0	the service was nice but not worth coming back .
0	i was totally disappointed with this place .
0	the waitress just left the mess she made for is to clean up .
0	it was _num_ degrees today .
0	it 's now to the point where it 's disgusting .
0	we 'll not go back .
0	the ice cream ( yogurt ) machine is no more .
0	i wanted to like it , i really did .
0	i was very disappointed .
0	the rest of the food items were just gross .
0	there is trash and food all over it .
0	not a great selection , but cheaper than sweet tomato .
0	still , gross !
0	that should have been washed properly , someone could get sick .
0	just went back this weekend .
0	not as good as 1st few times .
0	the place was crowded on monday morning ( labor day ) .
0	when you 're passing through town , get thee to the grocery .
0	my family of _num_ will not be returning .
0	she was yelling so loud that the entire restaurant went quiet .
0	which my mom was sitting at who uses a walker and has trouble moving .
0	again in a super loud voice we were told no .
0	myself and my family will not be returning to the place .
0	surprisingly we did n't wait too long until our party of _num_ was seated .
0	service was a bit slow and not that friendly .
0	our waitress seemed rushed and never even came back to refill waters .
0	i 've had better from other greasy spoon diners and brunch places in california .
0	i was a little disappointed with the quality and portion .
0	another incident that should n't have happened was in the bakery .
0	well , no kidding !
0	the lady who takes your order is rude .
0	the sides were terrible .
0	the mac n cheese was almost gone .
0	no mashed potatoes .
0	i was left with seafood salad and coleslaw .
0	there was no chicken on the inside .
0	i would have been better off at kfc .
0	this place is run down for a safeway .
0	the deli and prepared food area smells bad .
0	had the worst experience at the deli section .
0	she started yelling and giving me bad attitude .
0	i had to tell one of the managers but they did n't care .
0	to add to that , they are super slow !
0	i thought walmart cashiers were bad , these take the cake !
0	had the worst experience with safeway this week .
0	i got there and they only had one _num_ pack .
0	i do n't know , though , just my opinion .
0	so , his arrival did n't help the problem .
0	and left , never to return .
0	it did n't ring up so the cashier called someone .
0	they do n't live up to their name .
0	not smart and maybe not final .
0	he did n't care that my daughter had gotten sick .
0	his customers service skills are poor at best .
0	afterwards , i went about my various errands for the day .
0	it did n't take long to figure out what it was .
0	according to aaa , the wrong size filter was installed .
0	it just would n't be worthwhile .
0	but now there 's no way i 'll ever go back .
0	so i was immediately done with this place .
0	this place has horrible customer service .
0	terrible experience do n't recommend to anybody .
0	otherwise it would get zero stars from me .
0	the bad : where do i begin ?
0	the place is worn and old looking inside and out .
0	parking is horrible !
0	trying to get in and out is a constant challenge .
0	i could go on and on but i am sure you get the point .
0	now this place is just a serious dive with little to no redeeming qualities .
0	whose **** do i need to suck to get a drink around here ?
0	the tired bartenders are over worked and under staffed .
0	they lose a lot of points because of bad service .
0	both times the bartender was too busy to take my dinner order .
0	wo n't be this place .
0	terrible service .
0	only had one bartender and no server .
0	they really need a waitress to run the floor .
0	bomb wings but slow service .
0	cheap drink specials .
0	the staff is completely horrible and unprofessional .
0	i was ate wings but i taste weird .
0	if i could give _num_ stars i would .
0	will not be returning .
0	i was disappointed to see the prior yelp page removed - why ?
0	not anymore .
0	is n't that a little bit unethical ?
0	buying here was the mistake of the year .
0	it was like our couch was made from three leftover pieces they had .
0	every time i drive by the store i 'm reminded of the horrible experience .
0	it makes me never want to buy furniture again .
0	the communication with this store was awful !
0	getting by bed delivered was a pain .
0	i had _num_ minutes to make it to the new location before they closed .
0	no way i could make it across town on a friday night .
0	horrible customer service .
0	mattress is _num_ months old .
0	horrible wont ever go back .
0	i took my parents and unfortunately we were very disappointed .
0	she was not a fan of the hummus she had or the greek salad .
0	how can you mess up a greek salad ?
0	serve it with a limp iceberg and a bland dressing , that 's how .
0	i walked in and they told me they 're closed .
0	the customer service was very lousy today .
0	i would n't recommend this place to anyone .
0	there was no sign or anything to say i could n't park there .
0	i said , i 'm sorry , i did n't see any signs .
0	what a horrible experience !
0	however , just the other night , i found mold in my pizza .
0	customer service sucks .
0	will not be eating little caesars ever again .
0	service here sucked .
0	i can excuse the mess because i know how inconsiderate customers can be .
0	other than that i do n't know who else could appreciate this place .
0	so in conclusion , this store ... do n't , just ... do n't .
0	merchandise is really outdated .
0	this is the inventory that no one wanted .
0	no sales help , very depressing .
0	do n't plan on finding quality product at low prices .
0	i would give this place zero stars if i could .
0	employees were overly rude , inconsiderate and unprofessional .
0	they tried telling us we drove _num_ miles !
0	really disappointed with the service at this location .
0	when i arrived to pick it up they did n't have it .
0	they were rude and unapologetic .
0	so basically their guarantee is that there is no guarantee .
0	be polite on the phone , then hang up and talk crap about them .
0	would n't recommend this dentist to anyone .
0	the equipment they had was really outdated and painful .
0	why schedule appointments if you ca n't be ready to serve your patients ?
0	not like they 're doing the work for free !
0	office max has officially lost my business .
0	they do n't have my ink .
0	they do n't carry my series number ( _num_ ) only up to _num_ .
0	we did n't have to wait very long before our meal was delivered .
0	it was a empty bar .
0	walk up menu and salsa bar for lunch only .
0	so i was a little disappointed at this point .
0	it was n't horrible tasting food , just bland for what i prefer .
0	going in with coworkers for a quick bite to eat i ordered the nachos .
0	i pushed ignore .
0	but there came a point that i could ignore no more .
0	things were not right .
0	the food is not cooked all the way , and , none wears gloves .
0	i hate to give them just _num_ star .
0	it was terrible .
0	i seriously feel so gross right now after eating there tonight .
0	they are rude and dirty .
0	this is a warning : do n't go there !
0	but i have to get this off my chest .
0	sammy is my normal barber but he messed my hair up horribly yesterday .
0	i gave him the same instructions on how to cut my hair like always .
0	i will never be back to metro barber shop and not give anymore referrals .
0	you really ca n't go wrong with fried shrimp .
0	_num_ star for that and another for the yummy biscuits .
0	not cuz of the hair but because of the mediocre food .
0	disappointing .
0	bland .
0	no flavor .
0	and its not the first time that service was bad there .
0	ok , all done with red lobster for a good long while now .
0	host was friendly , waiter jeremy was super nice and manager was all smiles .
0	it was pretty odd for an almost empty restaurant .
0	i used to love the mussels appetizer , but this visit they were awful .
0	the coconut shrimp was ok .
0	i went to red lobster today with my family the service was horrible .
0	my appetizer was cold , half of the bowl of muscles were closed .
0	it was our first time at red lobster , and probably our last .
0	for app , we got the stuffed mushrooms with shrimp and lobster .
0	but , the shrimp linguini totally blew .
0	absolutely terrible service from our waitress .
0	waited _num_ minutes just for bread .
0	will not be coming back .
0	the hostess was very unfriendly .
0	they would n't remove it from our bill nor offer any discounts .
0	extremely disappointed .
0	this place sucks !
0	i really expected so much more but was completely disappointed .
0	with the first bite i knew it was not what i expected .
0	the meat was like a lunch meat instead of real sliced deli beef .
0	could hardly find the mozzarella either .
0	only good thing was the toasted bun .
0	do not stop here if you are wanting fast service .
0	bad bad bad !
0	do not stay here .
0	shame i ca n't give this place a lower review .
0	the management was rude .
0	the toilet in the room did n't stop running .
0	i wo n't be staying here ever again .
0	there is no plug for the the drain .
0	i asked if i could get one from an empty room .
0	the bathroom was disgusting .
0	the only thing worse than the room was the staff .
0	i ca n't understand how they 're still in business .
0	do n't ever ever ever stay at this hotel .
0	worst hotel experience ever .
0	i say again , do n't ever ever ever ever stay at this hotel !
0	i was disappointed that our pizza did n't have that this time .
0	just got a peter piper pizza for the 1st time in awhile .
0	i do n't know what happened but the crust is not the same .
0	too bad .
0	the cheese is different , the crust is different .
0	why why why ?
0	the wings are sorry .
0	if this is a recipe change it is not a good one .
0	the manager , steve , was very rude .
0	i totally agree but the way he said it was very arrogant .
0	when we received our order of wings , they were cold .
0	he was a total ass .
0	and the cashier was a complete bitch .
0	her attitude was disgusting .
0	so my wings came out _num_ mins before pizza was done .
0	making my wings get cold as i waited for the pizza to get done .
0	lots of issues with the games not working and not giving tickets out .
0	my food experience was just so strange and terrible at the same time .
0	the salad was heavy on the onions , easy on the anything else .
0	i do n't understand why they do n't do dressing either .
0	so the salad was a fail .
0	for the soup , i went with the chicken & gnocchi .
0	it did n't taste horrible , just cheap ... so only a minor fail .
0	food arrives , everything is normal , whatever .
0	( to eat , not to love , but to eat ) .
0	i strongly suggest something ( anything ) else .
0	may i recommend the apricot chicken or mixed grill ?
0	there where _num_ waiters , still service was slow .
0	both waiters where rude and condescending .
0	horrible service !
0	walked in and was told there was a 10-15 minute wait .
0	sat down and saw people getting seated that came in after i did .
0	she said , sorry you 're next .
0	night was ruined before i got my food .
0	i would normally give og a 3-4 .
0	first bite was great , then my wife commented that it was bleeding .
0	so i asked again for the manager and explained the situation .
0	i used to love olive garden but its become so blah .
0	so we sat there for _num_ minutes before she even sat us .
0	not thrilled with this place , probably wo n't come here again .
0	she was not even friendly !
0	heavy sauces , bland dishes and so-so service .
0	also , someone said the regulars are a joy to hang out with ?
0	maybe i am just visiting at the wrong time .
0	so i do not recommend this location plus , they hardly have anything .
0	the selection was better but probably because it 's a ghost town at metro .
0	do n't go to this metro location .
0	this place was filthy !
0	we found _num_ in a corner , the rest was n't cleaned .
0	several trays were empty , and were not refilled .
0	)
0	no words for this experience .
0	never again in this dump .
0	so disappointing .
0	the service was friendly but the food was not worth the money .
0	fried shrimp was over cooked .
0	when i first walked in , i was hit with that bathroom smell .
0	the food looked old , the lettuce wilted , it just looked gross .
0	the bread wasnt too bad .
0	yes , hoping someone would hear me .
0	there are three left and i believe this is the worst of them .
0	we gave up on getting him off our backs and walked out without ordering .
0	worst experience ever !
0	waiter dropped off food and never came back !
0	did n't care if we needed anything .
0	the chicken alfredo was nasty .
0	sauce tastes old and left over .
0	$ _num_ for two _num_ oz steaks _num_ salad bar .
0	absolute no seasoning on the nasty meat .

0	at the very best it should have been under $ _num_ for it all .
0	luckily no one here cares that they serve you horrible food .
0	the food was awful .

0	there is a texas roadhouse around the corner .

0	i asked for a to go box for a left over roll and shrimp .
0	the waiter said i could n't take the shrimp home because it was unlimited .
0	to the lazy manager you lost a loyal customer over shrimp !
0	so for _num_ , i would skip this place !
0	i was so very disappointed .

0	it 's a shame to watch this place take the turn it has .

0	it seemed gross and chewy .
0	_num_ .
0	_num_ .
0	upon entering , the atmosphere was just ok .
0	there was nothing special .
0	it simply did n't `` hit the spot '' so to speak .
0	it was a _num_ dollar bowl for crying out loud .
0	i declined the box and left my leftovers at the restaurant .
0	honestly this is one of the worst food dining experiences i have ever had .
0	all i ate there was crunchy rice and soy sauce .
0	i would not recommend this place to anyone ever .
0	there 's no chance i will ever be back .
0	guess it 's not my thing .
0	even the ice cream for dessert lacks luster .
0	no toppings , just soft serve vanilla ice cream .
0	to be honest the only thing that was good was the fountain drinks .
0	maybe mongolian grills are not my thing .
0	there was no one else in there .
0	lame .
0	went tonight on a recognition and was horribly disappointed .
0	this does n't even come close .
0	the meats looked like frozen , rolled up lunch meat .
0	my man did n't even finish his good and that never happens .
0	even the frozen yogurt did n't taste very good .
0	wow this place is bad .
0	the cashier asked who is going to eat because there is not sharing ?

0	now , the one advantage i thought was present , is not .
0	i took my _num_ yr old dog into her first teeth cleaning last week .
0	my poor pup , with no teeth at only _num_ yrs old .
0	i hate them for not giving me the option by calling me first .
0	this is a corporate vet and everything bad that corporate vets do .
0	i do n't know how else to put it .
0	so of course i am going to use the vet visit .
0	it is all about up sale and scare tactics at this vet .

0	after all , i am the customer .
0	this store sucks .
0	i would n't recommend it to anyone .
0	after they hook you , they do n't care .
0	from outside this place looks sketchy at best .
0	the place looks gross , old and not clean at all .

0	make sure you have time to burn , my mani/pedi took over two hours !
0	i called the salon before purchasing the groupon to check their availability .
0	the customer service that i experienced here was on par with any other salon .
0	however , this is a school .
0	as such , the quality and consistency of the services are not reliable .
0	it is simply awful .
0	i was very disappointed with my manicure .
0	my pedicure , however , turned out okay with minimal polish on the skin .
0	i would not recommend this salon , nor will i be returning .
0	when entering , i was willing to give the techs a chance .
0	usually , i could use my groupon right away but whatever '' .
0	i washed my hands _num_ times that night .
0	this is easily the worst motel _num_ i have ever stayed in .
0	i do n't care if it 's only $ _num_ .
0	it 's not good here .
0	not so good .
0	the manager was nice enough - no big deal .
0	i kept telling her no but she continued to insist she must come in .
0	of course , i called management and they said they would security immediately .
0	no child or baby here .
0	it was weird .
0	but no one told me !
0	the front desk never called to check if the situation had been resolved .
0	do n't stay here .
0	it 's just too weird .
0	i really do n't know if it was water .
0	the water was barely flowing .
0	this was beyond unacceptable !
0	worst motel ever !
0	lots of shady people out and about .
0	cops always seem to be here .
0	not a family friendly place at all .

0	the area seemed very sketchy .
0	i am glad we only stayed one night here .

0	this hotel sucks .
0	if i could give it a _num_ i would .
0	thank god we left at _num_ _num_ the next morning .

0	outside smells _num_ times better than my room did .
0	maintenance replaced the phone .
0	the next morning , we found that the water temperature would n't stay steady .
0	could n't get out of the there fast enough .
0	this hotel was the worst i have ever stayed in and felt very unsafe .
0	i reserved a room with _num_ double beds no smoking .
0	the front door was broken off of the cabinet that held the fridge .
0	that was the only good thing about this place .
0	call the front desk and request one , this is approx .
0	7:30 am , i am told i will have to wait till _num_ am .
0	i would rather be dirty than stay one more min in this place .
0	the worst place i ever stayed .
0	second night the room was not cleaned and no towels .
0	just uncomfortable .
0	my pillow case had a burned hole in it .
0	the non-smoking room reeked , but that was n't even the start .
0	the sheets , comforter , and towels were stained .
0	ridiculous .
0	i 've stayed at other super _num_ before and it was n't like this .
0	by far one of the worst shopping experiences i 've ever had .
0	it 's ghetto and the service is incredibly horrible .
0	i 'm never going there again .
0	i highly recommend that you never go here unless you want to get frustrated .
0	half the lights do n't work .
0	floor and ceiling look like they have been rode hard and hung up wet .
0	online pick up you better be ready for long delays .
0	no wonder they are closing down everywhere .
0	waited _num_ minutes at the service desk .

0	what i was not fine with .
0	nor will anyone else i know .
0	_num_ and a half hours for a quoted _num_ min oil change .
0	it would have been fine or i would have went else where .
0	very rude , will not come back .
0	but nothing show stopping .
0	i would n't go here for a meal ever again .
0	never again will i go back to this restaurant .
0	i am sad to see how much this place has gone downhill .
0	the food here is n't very good .
0	it has n't been for quite a few years .
0	the service the last time i went was just terrible .
0	i guess i need to spell that out more clearly next time .
0	ever since joes has changed hands it 's just gotten worse and worse .
0	there is definitely not enough room in that part of the venue .
0	so basically tasted watered down .
0	she said she 'd be back and disappeared for a few minutes .
0	i ca n't believe how inconsiderate this pharmacy is .
0	just left and took it off the bill .
0	it is n't terrible , but it is n't very good either .
0	definitely disappointed that i could not use my birthday gift !
0	new owner , i heard - but i do n't know the details .
0	but it probably sucks too !
0	we sit down and we got some really slow and lazy service .
0	the charge did include miso soup and a small salad .
0	there was no i 'm sorry or how did everything come out .
0	said we could n't sit at the table if we were n't ordering dinner .
0	the cash register area was empty and no one was watching the store front .
0	there chips are ok , but their salsa is really bland .
0	the wine was very average and the food was even less .
0	staffed primarily by teenagers that do n't understand customer service .
0	the burgers were over cooked to the point the meat was crunchy .
0	blue cheese dressing was n't the best by any means .
0	my pad thai tasted like thai rice noodles with barbeque sauce .
0	she said `` yes , sorry . ''
0	the store is dumpy looking and management needs to change .
0	there was only meat and bread .
0	when i complained in a polite way , i was walked out the door .
0	she was not happy being there .
0	moving past the shape , they were dry and truly tasteless .
0	the associates program is no longer an option .
0	the decor was seriously lacking .
0	anyway , we got our coffee and will not return to this location .
0	the sales people here are terrible .
0	salsa is not hot or good .
0	so i asked for the card to be refunded .
0	i just received a delivery order from them and essentially wasted my money .
0	i was n't going to let her do a thing further to me .
0	all she did was give me the run around and lied and bs everything .
0	the beans were in the burro in the rice was nowhere to be found .
0	they tried to take advantage of me because i am young .
0	we 've sent enough guests there who have returned absolutely livid with this restaurant .
0	always rude in their tone and always have shitty customer service !
0	they really need to work on their customer service and general attitude .
0	i skipped eating and we went back to the beer .
0	my `` hot '' sub was cold and the meat was watery .
0	when i first came to phx ... yes this sounded indian to me .
0	you wo n't find a better selection in scottsdale .
0	i asked for thai hot and received very little spice .
0	i was very sick the night after .
0	i left hungry and unsatisfied , never again .
0	i just left this car wash and was very unsatisfied !
0	had one mediocre meal and said , `` we 'll try again '' .
0	the food 's ok , the service is among the worst i have encountered .
0	this was my first stop in looking for a wedding dress .
0	then he proceeded to tell me how to fix it .
0	do not go to this practice they are horrible !
0	i guess she was n't happy that we were asking the prices .
0	the only saving grace was the black beans .
0	lost a long time customer !
0	other than that , food here is pretty gross .
0	i was also curious about another product but he straight up walked off .
0	so far i 'm not really impressed .
0	my groupon is only for the two windows .
0	safeway has officially lost my business to sprouts , & fresh & easy .
0	the food was pretty bad , i would not go there again .
0	we will not be using this location again .
0	this is a horrible venue .
0	you 'll have zero appetite after the first bite .
0	do n't go here unless you want to pay for crap .
0	but it may not actually be in stock anyway .
0	owner : a very rude man .
0	this place is a terrible place to live !
0	stopped by for soda after being at the hobby shop next door .
0	my dish was pretty salty and could barely taste the garlic crab .
0	it looks like blended up chicken put into the shape of grilled pieces .
0	what about the time i wasted ?
0	there are better happy hours and better beers all around mill !
0	the rooms are not that nice and the food is not that good either .
0	executive chefs would walk by not even saying good morning .
0	this spot was my favorite indian restaurant .
0	not even real brown sauce .
0	i will not revisit this course as a visitor with limited time to play .
0	but was very disappointed with what actually arrived .
0	his offer of a `` free dessert '' was even more atrocious .
0	i was so disgusted i could not way for the rest of the day .
0	the salads are ok , nothing special .
0	overall it was a miserable evening .
0	the woman did n't even apologize .
0	i expected service to be slow that morning , and it was .
0	zero complaints with his work .
0	the garlic bread was bland and cold .
0	the espresso was way too hot .
0	i know i should have sent this back and walk out .
0	they wo n't tell you though .
0	i love the food ... however service here is horrible .
0	gammage itself however is not so amazing .
0	needless to say i will not be back for mexican food .
0	i wo n't be ordering again .
0	let me give my opinion , that 's what this site is for .
0	she did not apologize or anything .
0	prices are just plain retail .
0	but this place was not economical so the expectation was different .
0	it smelled and tasted like yesterday 's oil .
0	who knows , it might have been .
0	the beer sauce is lackluster at best .
0	the building itself looks abandoned .
0	we 've tried the cream pancakes as well .
0	i 've never had a worse experience than this !
0	no , i 'm not at a scottsdale club .
0	if i could give zero stars i def would .
0	only now i 'm really hungry , and really pissed off .
0	no call , no nothing .
0	i wish i could give less than one star .
0	the wonton was seriously lacking filling .
0	if i could give less stars , i would .
0	she could not and would not explain herself .
0	think twice -- this place is a dump .
0	i 'm not one of the corn people .
0	it 's always busy and the restaurant is very dirty .
0	even if i was insanely drunk , i could n't force this pizza down .
0	as an arizona native , i have been going to the improv for years .
0	i got there , was seated pretty quickly , and then chose my color .
0	so , no treatment and no medication to help me deal with my condition .
0	at this location the service was terrible .
0	so who do i call to get my money back .
0	overcooked so badly that it was the consistency of canned tuna fish .
0	i 'm stuck in a lease otherwise i would move .
0	service was a little slow to begin with .
0	only then did our waitress show up with another styrofoam cup full of water .
0	the food was so-so and very over priced for what you get .
0	i hate to see what their delivery times are when it 's last call .
0	just went back to get the rear tire sealed and filled .
0	i expected so much better from this ny staple .
0	i had to leave a message , and they never called me back .
0	the food is worse than you find in the freezer section at walmart .
0	they tried real hard to get me to come back but i refused .
0	the security guard comes upstairs and pounds on our door demanding we open up .
0	i wanted to like this place but it just became a big disappointment .
0	i did n't know worker there can get tips from customer .
0	and the cleaning is way over priced .
0	they make a bad name for used car dealers .
0	when i was finally there , i was very disappointed .
0	just a frozen patty cooked like a home one .
0	so sad but i am not going back any more .
0	this is the worst walmart neighborhood market out of any of them .
0	the new management team is horrible !
0	just do n't bother ordering anything if you 're seated .
0	they also have lost sight of what good deli food is .
0	the evening started out slow .
0	i replied , '' um ... no i 'm cool .
0	the queen bed was horrible !
0	meanwhile i 'm waiting for an answer .
0	oh , i should not have asked .
0	my toddler found a dead mouse under one of the seats .
0	this place is just ok .
0	i have to say i was truly disappointed .
0	this is the reason i will never go back .
0	furthermore , there is no sausage or bacon on the menu .
0	when the manager finally showed up he was rude and dismissive !
0	the office also failed to even apologize about this whole horrific experience .
0	nope , way way worse .
0	there are no smiles and no customer service .
0	when she did n't answer him quickly enough , he hung up on her .
0	the fried rice was gross and there was a shit load of it .
0	if your patio is south facing , you 're out of luck .
0	plus the dude did n't even know how to work the computer .
0	overall : lost my business and recommendation for a good local camera place .
0	it was so odd , i asked her if she was joking ?
0	the food was mediocre at best , far too greasy and not cooked well .
0	food was cold ( still frozen ) , i had the ribs .
0	was n't busy , no biggie .
0	the bathroom area is nothing special .
0	this room that he found also reeked of smoke !
0	also , the food that is there is n't great even by buffet standards .
0	so i brought my business elsewhere .
0	exhibit c : no more student services peeps .
0	so disappointing from an old favorite .
0	it shows because on a saturday night there was n't a long wait .
0	tzatziki sauce had way too much dill in it .
0	the texture of the meat just looked and tasted wrong .
0	i will never visit the salon again .
0	they only received one star because you have to provide a rating .
0	i would n't go back there again .
0	this was by far the rudest person i spoke with .
0	the rest of their food is edible but their employees and service are horrible .
0	as for the food , never had it .
0	however , the tech said nothing to me about this .
0	i 'm from the bay area and this was a disappointment and over priced .
0	my mom ordered the teriyaki chicken bento box and i ordered the sashimi box .
0	i ordered garlic bread and fettuccine alfredo pasta with vegetables .
0	it does not take that long to cook sliders !
0	the sandwich was not that great .
0	the man did not stop her .
0	um ... we just told him that we did n't want to finance .
0	tasted really old , i could n't believe it .
0	it is also quite expensive for my taste .
0	food was alright maybe we should have ordered off the mexican menu .
0	lastly but not least , their brownie desert was ... meh .
0	it shows that this restaurant has no class .
0	one broken thing after another they do n't care to address .
0	we 've been to this long established restaurant many times .
0	my plate looked nearly half empty except for the small container of cole slaw .
0	when i arrived , no one was at the desk .
0	we gave it another 5-10 minutes before we got up and left .
0	even the ice cream was very , very run of the mill .
0	wendy 's has been know to be cheap with their drink refills for years .
0	as soon as they delivered i was like ugh .
0	the service is mediocre and the restaurant is just average .
0	but i darn sure could have cooked this one .
0	just terrible is all i can say .
0	did they not have a fountain machine on site ?
0	his egg sandwiches stink like feet and are slimy .
0	stay away , and go to cheesecake instead .
0	we stood there in shock , because we never expected this .
0	i 've eaten here many times , but none as bad as last night .
0	always takes way too long even if you 're the only one there .
0	however , everyone else paid after their nails were completed .
0	so , that was my one and only time ordering the benedict there .
0	overall , i do n't enjoy the place very much .
0	one of the employees apologized , but it did n't seem very sincere .
0	there is a reason they can get you in fairly quickly .
0	is zero stars an option ?
0	in the long run , they did absolutely nothing for me .
0	but let this story begin at noon today .
0	seriously though , i have never shopped here .
0	it is the absolute worse place in the valley .
0	but their inventory was questionable !
0	chicken fried chicken was dry but the green chili macaroni and cheese was good .
0	so he can charge a bloody fortune for them .
0	were we irritating her or something ?
0	this place has pissed me off for the last time .
0	do not sign a lease with these people .
0	do n't waste the trip .
0	had to returned one entree because too cold .
0	the restroom was a mess .
0	i mean that 's been my experience !
0	the beef taco was good but nothing special .
0	either way i would never recommend buying from camping world .
0	i went to sit down and wait for my order .
0	its also not a very clean park .
0	i tried to call repeatedly with no response .
0	they charged me for work not done , and parts not installed .
0	it looks old and outdated .
0	he did not return my call either .
0	if you travel a lot do not stay at this hotel .
0	i would rather wait for hot food than have it cold and soggy .
0	the food here is bland and boring and bad .
0	this one is not on the ball .
0	for the record i am a good cook , i use seasoning !
0	the tow package is not an issue either .
0	very crowded , difficult to have a chance to actually have a good time .
0	i think it 's terrible when employees act that way .
0	i 'll keep looking for a different salon .
0	you can not pay me to ever shop here !
0	french toast plate was good , mom said , but eggs were cold .
0	now the food : not horrible , but below average .
0	this is easily the worst greek food i 've had in my life .
0	no stars is what in want to give .
0	when it came we should have sent it back .
0	the equipment is so old and looks dirty .
0	i 'm not willing to take the chance .
0	this place smelt like old urine for some reason .
0	bottom line they over promise and under deliver .
0	i dont know why i was expecting anything different .
0	nothing that special about this place .
0	razz 's failed on every occasion .
0	management no longer cares about the golf experience .
0	20-30 % capacity at most , i was the only one in the pool .
0	the chow mein was very mushy and had weird texture .
0	found the place even though it is hard due to bad signage .
0	not sure and i do n't care !
0	two hours of my life i can never get back .
0	dropped off my red purse and three pair of black shoes .
0	very disappointed and would stay clear of this place .
0	service fair , pace was bad between courses - long waits .
0	second time , not so good .
0	the bread was soggy and the dip was inedible .
0	he did n't even offer another time for me to come in .
0	what the hell are you doing ?
0	the lady at the front desk was not very friendly .
0	i was not impressed , and would not recommend this place .
0	the dipping sauce was too sweet too .
0	finally , the cheese crisp was tiny and was anything but crisp .
0	i checked online , and the coupon site said my certificate was good .
0	liar , liar , pants on fire .
0	parking : no signs or anything , so you just have to guess .
0	i should have stuck with sun chinese dining .
0	not so great food and service .
0	this is an old worn out hotel .
0	the pizza is offered without toppings and it 's lacking in flavor .
0	the mechanics are very amateur as usual .
0	this place is beyond a shit hole .
0	this place is a shit hole with shit service .
0	however , it turned out to be nothing like i thought it would .
0	went back in for adjustment , realized still incorrect .
0	service was just as disappointing .
0	i do not recommend anyone to this starbucks .
0	the only thing i was offered was a free dessert .
0	management does not seem to care .
0	i had a horrible experience , and i sadly would not come back .
0	it is not really brown rice .
0	did n't even get a response .
0	needless to say , i contacted the store manager directly after leaving .
0	my wife came in for alterations and was treated quite rudely .
0	i ordered a cesar salad with a side of blackened chicken .
0	had it not been so terribly hot , it would have just been inconvenient .
0	she did offer me a copy if i would like a soda while waiting .
0	i emailed to let them know but they apparently dont care .
0	i suppose id forgotten how bland their offerings really are .
0	it did n't get finished .
0	we will not be coming back .
0	he could n't actually read her pressure , though .
0	absolutely terrible , do not order from this place .
0	ate kicked ass , marquee , not so much .
0	even the water tasted horrible .
0	and the food is simply not as good as the other locations .
0	sounds good does n't it ?
0	but it was disgusting and hot in there .
0	yes , the portions were large , but size is n't everything .
0	it was over fried and very hard .
0	i have not received such an attitude toward a customer before .
0	the overall prices are not competitive with frys .
0	too bad it was at the expense of the other customers .
0	we 'll see if that happens , but i 'm not holding my breath .
0	and management does n't do anything about it .
0	no wonder these restaurants are closing up all around the valley .
0	what were you going to charge me when i purchase a dozen bagels ?
0	i 'm still craving my drunken noodles !
0	these days the quality is pretty lousy .
0	this woman should not be in the service industry in az with that attitude .
0	service was average but could not make up for the poor food and drink .
0	my husband had to walk up to the bar to place our wine order .
0	and the pizza was cold , greasy , and generally quite awful .
0	maybe they were having a bad night ?
0	this place is dirty and run down and the service stinks !
0	the only thing we received that was hot was the coffee .
0	so , it went in the trash .
0	it was embarrassing for all involved , though i do n't think he noticed .
0	so i ordered my tires online , scheduled an appointment for two days out .
0	hopefully , i do n't take any bed bugs with me .
0	the beer is n't bad , but the food was less than desirable .
0	when it finally came out , it was bad .
0	talk about false advertising so call before you go !
0	the food is n't too bad but the service is terrible .
0	crab cakes , salt , no other flavor .
0	but the customer service ruins it all for me .
0	i just walked out , called the manager to complain .
0	i was very disappointed with this place .
0	so you are n't my problem . ''
0	unfortunately , the tour guides are not experts .
0	geez i need to find a source for those uni blocks ... .
0	she does n't say anything and just walks away .
0	the others ordered the short rib hash , also over-cooked and dry .
0	the staff was nowhere to be found .
0	it tasted like melted plastic and had the same tough consistency .
0	it did n't matter of she is good at all other times .
0	i acknowledged this and he went back to take care of the bill .
0	save your money & your patience .
0	what a waste of my time and theirs .
0	one was for my dog , and one was for my wife 's dog .
0	my fault for not looking more closely , i guess .
0	the server was n't buying .
0	worst customer service i have ever had .
0	sad what has happened to this sandwich shop .
0	and for this reason , i wo n't return .
0	this branch is getting worse and worse .
0	they failed to tell us eating in the bar was an option .
0	they can thank you for the low rating .
0	i did n't even eat it .
0	this was the first time i ever cried from a haircut .
0	there was no personality to our server .
0	if i was n't with my coworker , i would 've walked out .
0	i did n't know ra was a chain .
0	i 'm sure they must get it right some days but not this day .
0	went to the sunday brunch to celebrate our daughter 's college graduation .
0	this is the third time they 've messed up that spice .
0	the game room is a waste of time , energy and money .
0	i also told him i would leave him some good feedback online .
0	however , the manager came back & told me my order was coming up .
0	is that a good thing or a bad thing ?
0	maria the manager is a horrible person .
0	it was so much not good that i just wanted out of there .
0	we told them to forget it , we did n't want to wait .
0	first , the bartender was an a -- hole .
0	absolutely ridiculous stay away from this place .
0	i guess even great restaurants have bad days .
0	oh well , who cares ... right ?
0	we will spend our money elsewhere .
0	i will never purchase another lv bag again .
0	uneven pieces and falling apart -- i paid for that .
0	we did n't leave with anything that day .
0	horrible , horrible , horrible service !
0	now it is not so thin and taste like any other pizza place .
0	this piece of shit gave me wonton crackers for my soup .
0	i 'm not a fan of huge chain restaurants .
0	the rice was cold and hard and the taste was very bland .
0	you can not judge people based on appearance .
0	you are not the only place in town with decent pizza .
0	the thai basil pasta came out lukewarm and spicy .
0	no courtesy and their food is pathetic .
0	i would never reccomend anyone to live here .
0	had to wait a month to get in .
0	great food but horrible staff and very very rude workers !
0	it was my last weekend visiting my folks .
0	next dish was moo goo gai pan to which the sauce is the secret .
0	do not go here if you are interested in eating good food .
0	prime rib was fatty and not cooked per requested .
0	tonight i lost all respect for this company .
0	safe to say we will be going to other walgreens locations from now on .
0	i may make it back to the bar but i will skip the restaurant .
0	let me tell you , this place was far from busy !
0	it 's not much like an actual irish pub , which is depressing .
0	the birthday surprise has been ruined as well as her special day .
0	included in this price was a credit card fee and an after midnight fee .
0	the only item was able to eat was the soggy broccoli beef !
0	other than that , i really do n't know what was good about it .
0	the food is not that authentic .
0	actually , just keep walking .
0	unfortunately , it is the worst .
0	the place has obviously gone downhill over the years .
0	not so much these days .
0	did n't feel like dealing with the restaurants closer to asu .
0	this is the worst panda express location there is !
0	the door would n't open at all .
0	my services were very rushed and she did n't even do a good job .
0	the ceiling air conditioner in the hallway is very loud .
0	we then placed our order with our extremely rude and apparently completely overwhelmed server .
0	i may just post pictures to prove their shoddy work .
0	it is way overpriced ( compare to what they serve !
0	this is a terrible college .
0	my jack and coke was seriously lacking .
0	sadly , i will probably never be able to eat at this place again .
0	the falafel 's looked like chicken nuggets , and were lacking flavor .
0	i looked around and there were still customers .
0	i said it was disgusting to even serve this to diners .
0	we both found it overcooked -- and no seasonings .
0	in turn my legs are burnt from the noodles and all over the floor .
0	avoid if at all possible .
0	i do not like to be screwed over , or short changed .
0	we asked how long the wait would be , she said she was unsure .
0	it 's just too expensive for what you get .
0	also , could they not bring a single pack of cheese or red peppers ?
0	went into this location to drop it off .
0	we went there on a busy holiday weekend and the service was extremely slow .
0	if i was the manager , i 'd fire that kid on the spot .
0	too bad too because they brew an outstanding beer .
0	the food was low quality and thrown together quickly with little flavor .
0	the beer was nice and cold !
0	the woman who works in the deli is horrible .
0	will never go back to kfc - they essentially stole from me !
0	there are much better places for breakfast .
0	the surly older waitress was a huge bummer .
0	it 's not my fave , but it 's not awful .
0	um , yah , it does n't need replacing just yet .
0	pathetic place , worst food .
0	needless to say , i will not be returning to this place ever again .
0	firstly , their fees are generally higher than other places .
0	anything they say , ask in writing .
0	this is a far cry from real new mexican cuisine .
0	but unfortunately the rude woman was the one checking us out .
0	built in cabinets in kitchen and bathroom along with sink are not kept up .
0	bad service in these areas and really ruined our visit .
0	if i had wanted it washed i would have washed it myself !
0	she just grabbed a couple empty dishes and walked off .
0	incredible , low price specials and the occasional groupon .
0	the green enchiladas were ok but not great .
0	the problem is nothing was good .
0	i tried to no avail .
0	university is also almost as bad as living on apache .
0	horrible job on nails and toes .
0	i refused to purchase any of the pictures based on quality .
0	perhaps bread should be offered at no charge .
0	simply , there are far superior places to go for sushi .
0	took my suite to get fitted and a new button put on it .
0	sketchy sketchy sketchy pizza delivery !
0	that person didnt get their meal until everyone else was finished with their meal .
0	the place is small , i 'm sure she could have figured it out .
0	they rush , rush and do n't pay attention to their customers .
0	desert followed but nothing special .
0	no massage with my manicure or pedicure .
0	i called at 6:30 and got the complete brush off .
0	however , this experience went pretty smooth .
0	they 're nowhere near any fight that breaks out .
0	since their visit , the only scorpions we 've seen were dead !
0	she was getting pissed , and so were we .
0	did n't seem to care about their job .
0	would have rated lower if i could .
0	not personalized or warm at all .
0	so one person would eat while everyone else was sitting and waiting for theirs .
0	i do not like the size of the dance floor .
0	this location is super busy and really could use double the staff .
0	i guess starbucks customer services is only good at some locations .
0	their cheese i 'm certain was of the string variety .
0	no , not the ones at asu , the ones in junior high .
0	three women met for lunch last friday at elements at the sanctuary .
0	ra sushi , you are so blah to me .
0	half of my head was over processed .
0	an old dude did my pedicure .
0	like it 's been in a fridge for a week .
0	`` no , we are going to have a tournament tomorrow .
0	when i picked up the order , i was given another totally different price .
0	they do not stock some of the most common parts .
1	these donuts have the perfect texture and taste .
1	good food for the price .
1	a little dirty on the inside , but wonderful people that work there !
1	i always order it when i go there and it is always awesome .
