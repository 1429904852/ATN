1	around the same time my dad got his very first iphone
1	it can charge a usb device while charging your phone
1	after about a week ,  the whole basement was a little clearer
1	i wasn t expecting much because theprice was so low
1	it is generic product ,  but worth every single penny
1	this headset can take a lot of abuse
1	just the right size for the in between jobs
1	battery life is a little less than other phones we have had but still lasts all day
1	if you want a fun way to protect your phone ,  this is the way
1	very small but it works great in the car
1	i can hear a noticeable amount of hiss and loss of clarity
1	then i worried about the quality and whether or not it would look cheap and flimsy
1	that you have to remove ,  but i don t consider this a drawback
1	i don t see how you can beat that
1	i had been looking for a long time and i am delighted with the set
1	the dogtag chain relieves strain from the earbuds and can be hidden discreetly under your shirt
1	i don t own much expensive cookware ,  although i wish i could afford it
1	from a distance i have people say they could not tell that it was a phone case ! 
1	first ,  one corner of the case doesn t snap on real well ,  and when dropped ,  it pops off a little
1	for the price ,  this knife does the job
1	best case out there for an extended battery
1	just have to be patient in installing ,  also have really steady hands
1	i did a lot of research before buying this processor
1	nice pan !  this pizza pan is a great size
1	i don t mind that and just get another one
1	does require a bit of guess work ,  but still not difficult
1	this is the best blade grinder i have found
1	great item ,  highly rated by my fave cooking mag from the east coast that has a pbs tv show
1	i m sure they will stay fresher in the jars than in the bag with a close pin
1	you would think the description would say  hose sold separately  or something to that effect
1	i really loved it and will use it alot
1	we got this kit for our daughters num_extend birthday kit to make her cake
1	not totally regularly shaped ,  and look a little cheap
1	love the quality stainless ,  as well as the long slender design
1	while i own a ceramic sharpening device ,  i still haven t had to use it on either knife
1	look great !  neutral to go with any curtain color
1	the nonstick coating is just as good ,  if not better than other commercial grill pans
1	charge performance is quick and handles all that i throw at it
1	the water is just as tasteless ,  but the flow is much better
1	this roughness allows for food to stick on the skillet more than on those other types of skillets
1	most of this can be resolved by rooting the phone and putting a custom rom on num_extend
1	nice cover ,  cheap price ,  easy to install ,  fit the motorola photon perfect
1	i can roast vegetables quickly in it ,  and even bake muffins
1	there were campsites where i was the only one with cell service
1	i have the silicone handle which helps prevent burns
1	preheat the press with hot water while getting coffee ground and heating water
1	boil water until timer darkens to your specific needs
1	then use the back of a spoon to smooth the label ,  thereby increasing the adhesive strength
1	nokia suite will offer to upgrade the software from num_extend to symbian anna
1	you will not believe this   this zyliss is an amazing kitchen tool
1	if you have a choice ,  i would definitely research shun and henckel
1	the bottle is leak resistant with zero condensation
1	you have evenly cooked ,  crispy pizzelles in no time
1	so i was happy to find this ,  seasoned it and used it a few times ,  now it s perfect
1	pour boiling water into the bottom reservoir  with bottom filter removed  ,  one half inch from the top
1	we re using ciao bella book of gelato and highly recommend the purchase of this book with the lello
1	fits very well and is durable plastic for good protection
1	the business i work at is very problematic for cell phone reception
1	it gets the job done and for the price you can t beat it
1	son has this on his nokia num_num and with use and abuse ,  this protective hard skin works perfectly
1	i used almost all of my christmas bonus ,  in num_extend to buy the dyson animal num_extend
1	the pictures will show two spots ,  one half of one i had already cleaned before i took the picture
1	and dont want to carry a purse or wallet
1	it works perfectly !  i m very happy with the price ,  the product and how quickly it arrived
1	blade is really sharp and got the results that i was expecting
1	after looking around at other products like this such as the incipio feather and casemate barely there
1	this vornado heater is pure luxury to me
1	my husband usually uses my hand mixer beater to whisk sauces
1	this machine is easy to use ,  just plug and go
1	however ,  the overall sound quality both ways is better and the fit is more comfortable than the jawbone
1	this will be my second of these scrapers
1	don t give this amazing tool a bad review just because you were sent a different model
1	not a big deal ,  but much larger than i expected
1	i am very happy with the purchase and the installation was easy
1	i have owned any number of strainers over the years ,  but never one like this
1	it seems that all of the family didn t have enough chargers
1	they re my favorite glasses for serving up mixed drinks
1	it really just sits lightly over your ear
1	it comes with a dough hook too even though i didn t see it in the description
1	i liked it so much ,  i ordered an additional one for my hubby
1	i bought this on amazon quite some time ago
1	everyone recommends this knife ,  so no one will read this comment
1	very highly recommended because of their quality and how heavy and sturdy the glass is
1	i was familiar with corelle already so i knew they would never break or chip
1	i purchased a few of these to keep at different locations
1	it s not like real espresso ,  but it gets as close as you can for very little money
1	the meat is only partially thawed when i slice it ,  but it works great
1	i bought this pan specifically to make corn bread
1	the wide top reduces and concentrates flavors amazingly fast
1	great price and it noticeably filters tap water that i can smell coming out of the faucet
1	i needed this for canning items that don t do well with oxygrn absorbers like sugar
1	for this price $ for what looks like same case in mall  it is a real winner
1	i ve been a fan of otterbox products for a long time
1	give it a chance ,  you won t be disappointed ! 
1	i wanted to make strawberry and i had some frozen ones that i had thawed
1	who knew    i followed both machine recipes for basic bread
1	it is easy to use and fits the iphone num_num great
1	i can t speak for the white one but the black one did crack around the volume buttons
1	this is a manuel machine ,  but it works great
1	wish i didn t have to buy two though
1	i needed a set with a goldtone accent to go with my gold rimmed plates
1	this pan performed great searing and then braising of pork chops
1	this machine just keeps on brewing and frothing
1	oh ,  by the way   you can wash these holsters ,  too
1	the extra life of these batteries was overrated
1	i wish there was an option for better than perfect service as this company deserves it
1	this is good since you would have to convert your own recipes to the above proportions
1	they are very comfortable in your ears and people can hear you very well
1	but ,  a huge disappointment was the lid !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  the paperwork that came with the jar says made in the usa
1	five days a week we use the beeps as our alarm clock
1	so ,  it won t bother me when i work
1	being a mom of small kids ,  i can certainly say :  can not do without it
1	it also will tell you when you have turned it off
1	i have given several way as gifts and they were all pleased
1	practical tips for quick and sure assembly :  num_extend
1	i have bought two additional ones for gifts and have had dozens more bought by my recommendation
1	my first tuna asparagus creeps in cream sauce were a success
1	it looks great and i hang most of my pots and pans from it   and we re talking cast iron here
1	it grinds grains without making too much noise
1	awesome stylus !  perfect weight ,  size and love this type of tip
1	iced tea machine for many years ,  but i think this product is far superior
1	i really like how sturdy they are and how clear they look
1	worth buying a few or more to have in the car ,  briefcase ,  house and whatnot
1	so ,  you always have to have a hot pad or towel num_extend
1	i hastily ordered her another one and it arrived on time
1	they really are invalueable and worth every penny
1	the price is right and so is the item try it , you ll like it too
1	they give you everything you need and its worth the price although the iphone shield prices are pretty good
1	but i ve seen many people with this so thought i would give it a try
1	i thought it would be hard to replace but watched video on youtube and worked out fine
1	dust ,  sand ,  dog hair ,  cat hair and a leaf
1	shaped a little weird ,  but is an awesome fan
1	the excellent instruction manual that comes with this cooker lists appropriate cooking times for many kinds of food
1	it isn t very convenient though compared to a real lid
1	they proceed faster when the wine is warm and slow down when it s cool
1	these knives are made in china from stamped stainless steel ,  as indicated in the specs an explanation :  j a
1	very durable and total molded design is great
1	it charges anything that uses usb ,  just like you d expect
1	also it is larger than it looks in the picture ! 
1	i have purchased these for gifts as well
1	i m an avid amateur cook ,  and love entertaining
1	this product is excellent and unlike the comment in one review ,  i have noticed no plastic taste
1	frost color looks nice on the cell phone and feels durable
1	this is extremely important to avoid any num_extend the lid grip is thin and hard to remove
1	guess it has been a while since i had used or needed a double boiler ?  ! 
1	most new phones are going to soft buttons
1	they gave me a week to see if any more problems popped up
1	looks brand new ,  already made a few things and it seems to work perfectly
1	a year and a half with two kids and no casualties so far
1	i love just looking at it ,  but i love it even more using it
1	there needs to be room at the top of kettle to contain boiling water
1	the price was right and it came very quickly after i ordered it
1	and a quicker path through the filter results in incomplete brewing ,  and ,  bitterness
1	the sound is alright but they are good because they block outside sounds
1	when my old one finally rusted away  after num_num years  ,  i was thrilled to find this as a replacement
1	i m saving my receipt and if that happens i ll be very disappointed
1	i have gotten no complaints from people i call and am on the phone a lot
1	i am a first time user so am not an expert
1	it still cooks great and cleans as easy as it did new
1	do it right and it will make a nice seal
1	it also allows sending text messages through desktop  when phone is connected 
1	it works like a charm and you really get a very similar product
1	this little tool is perfect and can t understand why i never invested in one before
1	seems to be in great condition ,  arrived very quickly
1	all stainless ,  so don t worry about wearing anything out
1	i changed screen protectors twice i believe in a matter of nearly a year
1	this was an easy fix up for the board
1	will review again when i have more experience with it
1	this knife was no exception to that; razor sharp out of the box
1	i have tried all manner of other ways to integrate my iphone easily with my car
1	this is about the same size with the same size screen
1	if you own a evo you should own this as well
1	i ordered a trailer ball and it was in the same box packed loose
1	nice and heavy ,  very solid and easy to use because of the heft
1	the incredible was a great phone for the most part but it ate through battery
1	but this headset works really well and also obviously can stand up to some unique challenges
1	yeah ,  i complain about cleaning it ,  but as far as juicers go ,  this one is easy to clean
1	i even wrote to krups and was not given any explanation
1	this one was just as good as my old one !  i was so glad ! 
1	i thought they were so cute i even put one on my daddy s ipad
1	to activate discoverable mode you simply press and hold the call button until the bluetooth indicator starts flashing
1	i bought these because my zaggs wouldn t stay on while running
1	the key   you have to remove the phone from the case ,  which is very inconvenient ! 
1	the key number to pay attention to is the second one ,  the rated amperage
1	i got the recommendation from cooks illustrated ,  and it works like a charm
1	i paired it to my cell phone in a matter of seconds with absolutely no problems
1	this is very nice i had to register this handset
1	it is a nice heavy glass and if used for what it was intended for it will last forever
1	i would never have even thought about purchasing anything that was reconditioned until i read the reviews here
1	i m hoping we have many years of trouble free use with this machine
1	i use these with iphone num_extend and a blackberry curve+ auto shutoff after the phone moves out of range
1	the light indicators for the battery life and connection status are wonderful
1	will work well with cheese ball and crackers or small slices of pound cake ,  etc
1	i bought this one because the original cable i had was ripping apart
1	it works for my iphone num_num that needed a new battery
1	i switch battery s often so i need to be able to remove the cover easily
1	i highly recommend them and for the price i don t see how you could beat them
1	the back plate offers great protection and new charging options
1	very handy ,  size is great but everytime i use ,  it seems to take a little bit more finish off
1	compare vendors shipping charges as well as the unit price for your best purchase price
1	that is a bit awkward but eventually it worked
1	if you take good care of the cast iron dutch oven ,  it ll serve you very well and your generations
1	it is a classic design that is beautiful enough to leave out in the open
1	but the thing is ,  i don t think they should bend
1	it s sturdy and well made ,  i m very happy with the purchase
1	i need to up my game to keep up with my new board
1	i have had my cuisinart machine for num_extend years
1	she had been using an otterbox commuter but was dissatisfied with that case s bulk
1	when i look at its picture while ordering i never think it should be same as in the pics
1	i mounted some cambridge soundworks surround speakers on the stands with no problems
1	i am very attached to certain wooden spoons   i use different spoons for different sorts of stirring
1	the outside chrome part ,  does get very hot
1	and they make the phone easier to grip while protecting the surface
1	voice guide is great and answering with my voice is faster than i though
1	of course ,  you ll probably figure that out for yourself
1	this is a must have for anyone who has a cell phone
1	charges my nokia num_extend at a fairly fast rate
1	one being the loudness of the unit seemed a tad low ,  and the fit didn t seem quite right
1	i had no feeding or jamming problems whatsoever my only issue with this device is using it to stuff sausages
1	excellent peeler ! so many peelers just don t work that well
1	i gave it the benefit of the doubt and used it anyway
1	for me ,  this handle is too big ,  and i feel like my wrist is an awkward angle
1	great quality stainless steel ,  good weight ,  nice looking !  i love all the oxo products i have
1	is it a wonder why this coffee grinder is rated number num_extend
1	its a neck lanyard which is pretty standard
1	i just received this guy yesterday and tried it out last night with a large sweet potato
1	the turkey fit nicely in the pan and came out very moist and flavorful
1	it is basically just a big luggage tag ,  but it does an adequate job
1	update :  my newest sanyo microwave convection oven quit after working for a little over two years
1	i highly recommend it !  you will not be disappointed
1	as for the pan itself ,  i couldn t be happier with it
1	the flashlight is not very bright ,  i would say about as bright as a keychain flashlight ,  if that
1	you release the lock mechanism at the top and press down
1	use wooden or plastic utensils and you won t scratch the finish
1	the blender does what a usual blender is supposed to do
1	but ,  i would not suggest blending anything hard  like ice  in a canning jar
1	i bought num_num sizes of the golden holiday tablecloth and matching place mats
1	what a well made docking device !  this was one of the fastest shipped items i have purchased from amazon
1	my only complaint is the latch that keeps it shut ,  is a little aggrivating
1	everything sticks and it s a bear to clean
1	you can also rotate it to fit it in your left or right ear
1	it is really handy !  my cabinet was a mess and this helped me to get things better organized
1	i thought it would be a little tricky to clean the blades but it couldn t be easier
1	cost $ and had plenty to choose from
1	i love the blade cover; that s probably my favorite part about this
1	i was able to sync this within about num_num minute to my droid num_extend
1	there are different types of burr grinders but the conical type is supposed to be the best
1	everything fits perfectly in the case and it makes everything much neater
1	i love the look of this charger first off
1	for the oat flour   also use an equal amount of whole wheat flour   i have been using  quakers   old fashion oats 
1	the agility has a removable hood making this area easy to clean
1	otherwise ,  the calls seem good on this plantronics num_extend bluetooth earpiece
1	a also like the web strap underneath it fits about num_num wash cloths
1	this pan is a wonderful addition to my calphalon collection
1	they are sturdy yet beautiful ,  and are the perfect size for pasta ,  casseroles ,  rice dishes ,  and more
1	the numbers on each are etched solidly into the rubber handgrips ,  ensuring they won t disappear anytime soon
1	this phone is really cool and i recommend it for anyone looking for a bad ass phone
1	great for cutting ,  chopping and scraping ,  i wonder what i used to use before i got one of these
1	i ve only used these pans a few times ,  so far ,  but they re working out great
1	at its current price of less than $ it s really a steal as well
1	most of the time ,  the person on the other side didn t notice that i was on a bluetooth
1	the powerful motor is more than enough for any job
1	it s had the best crema on my espresso this side of italy
1	i just loved the colors when i saw this and had to have it
1	the chopsticks are nice ,  and come with grips on them for extra  grabbing  power
1	my charger works just fine   it charges my phone quickly
1	they fit on very snugly ,  and the screen is just as sensitive as when the phone is bare
1	and then there are the general uses ,  the logical ones that come to mind   closing bags of chips and crackers
1	buy more than you think you need ,  you ll use  em
1	the sound quality is amazing for music and phone conversations
1	don t put in ear while crazy glue is wet
1	only a percolator perfectionist would really notice that difference
1	after that i gave the slicer another chance
1	highly recommend these to people to use on their whiteboards or refrigerators
1	i have purchased these glasses num_num times now to have them engraved for going away gifts
1	used this to shove into doughnut holes  i cheated on actual cake pops 
1	this was a really good price for the cord
1	sometimes i have to keep mobile in dusty places
1	there is no  jumping around  of the appliance on the counter when it s in use
1	there is a size or two up that i like the best from oxo however
1	i like this sifter especially for making cakes that require folding in sifted ingredients in portions at a time
1	it eliminates sediment and any traces of bitterness
1	this one was at a great price and it works well
1	and even better ,  nobody can compare with kitchenaid s customer service care centeer
1	i had never defrosted anything in a microwave that didn t get cooked on the edges until now
1	it s ideal for those recipes that combine measures ,  e g  ,   one cup plus two tablespoons of sugar 
1	brita makes a great product ,  and the price on amazon makes it worth buying here
1	i d recommend it for anyone that wants easy access to their credit cards and id
1	if you love apples and pears ,  this is a must have tool
1	that s the only reason i didn t give it five stars
1	i personally have no need for a kickstand so this works great
1	i ve had my case for about num_num months now and use it everyday
1	rv s are subject to much dust not to mention we change environments  pollen types  on a continuing basis
1	as a former commercial meat cutter i ve had years of experience with this type product
1	we have used it every day for a month
1	would recommend it to anyone who s a user of ram mount products
1	upon switching to the iphone num_extend it has continued to work
1	the curved shape of the premier is the shape of this little processor
1	the plastic will have some staining over time but doesn t effect the use of the product
1	many have complained about the lid or the product being thin and easily breakable
1	wow ,  i was so wrong ! the popcorn maker comes in num_num simple to assemble parts and then the cardboard concentrator
1	i do hand wash ,  immediately after use and then dry
1	i was pleasantly surprised when the product arrived and did indeed have a brushed finish
1	i assure you that the product is as good as these reviews claim
1	the pots has a nice weight to them
1	the discovery num_num seemed to fit the bill
1	i was so happy i bought the regular jar sealer also
1	it is just so much nicer to be able to grind spices with one hand
1	works effortlessly to make smooth ,  thin sheets of pasta
1	this is a must have for the phones
1	as many folks out there ,  including anthony bourdain i too was scared of pressure cookers
1	no soap or abrasive cleaners of any kind
1	so when i saw this num_num on sale ,  i thought i was upgrading
1	i m glad when i did ,  i chose a boos
1	it fits all jars perfectly and cans well
1	protects my phone and it s simple to put on and take off
1	i bought the bodum because i like the looks better and it costs less
1	saves time ,  space and just plain awesome for those of us that can
1	so i decided to get myself a second one
1	extremely well made with every size imaginable in a handly storage tin for a very reasonable price
1	the challenge for me was making the drink hot enough
1	much cheaper than the apple version and works just as well
1	this fit his phone perfectly !  both of us are pleased with the purchase
1	i owned the old version of this same brand and model which served me well for num_extend years
1	cant wear it on my ears with my glasses without adjusting it some since thats uncomfortable
1	you just cut lemon in half ,  and press it on the top of the juicer
1	haven t dropped it yet ,  so hopefully it will hold up
1	i like the vocalyst service as well ,  even though i don t use it often
1	i have the time and the inclination to can again
1	the shipment was recieved on time ,  it worked for blackberry num_num car charger
1	i love that i can take it from vehicle to vehicle with me
1	it is very easy to use and has all the necessary things to make it a very handy product
1	i am happy with the order and you will be too
1	i asked for this for christmas so i could make tea at my desk at work
1	the lip on the top makes for pain free pressing for continued use
1	these are the best forks i have ever found for crab legs
1	we have num_num of these pots at church
1	it is great for traveling and using the map app
1	i have bought a couple as gifts and always have a replacement on hand
1	i did and this was the closest to my old one
1	as always with cuisinart ,  quality goods !  grinds the beans quickly and easy to clean
1	i have thrown out many others ,  i always have two on hand
1	the soft plastic lid seals tight enough to use it as a shaker
1	i got this originally for under $  used   came sealed in it s package ,  though 
1	but    now i am getting a new one i have had this product for about a year and a half
1	this counter undercount is awesome and i have more counter room
1	i ve called ,  but haven t reached a clueful cingular support rep yet
1	we have had these same shears for years
1	i would never have thought i would switch brands but so far ,  so good with the kitchen aid
1	really liked how grippy the sides of the phone are
1	i normally go though cases in a few months
1	recommended for people who cook small to medium amounts of rice at least two times a week
1	each glass size ended being exactly what i like
1	great versatility with the usb port that could charge any device
1	over num_num years ago i used a pressure cooker on a regular basis
1	they are to the t and if followed the likelyhood of messing up is slim
1	i use this in between with just hot water
1	get it hot ,  just be fore it starts to smoke ,  add your rice
1	thanks to the seller for sending me a quality  new  product
1	it is clean and it locks  the lock is a little tricky to work 
1	they re made of glass so they behave more like pyrex in the microwave
1	nice design ,  easy to assemble and decent quality
1	about this product because of the low price
1	i am hoping it will last her through several years ,  but we will have to wait and see
1	the num_num cup capacity has always been more than enough for my family of three as well
1	i got this phone num_num weeks after its launch mid june num_extend using it daily ,  and just about every feature
1	i ve heard they are great with repairs if you need one
1	it won t wreck it   this thing cooks everything we ve thrown in it perfectly
1	the only thing better would have been getting a new mixer
1	however ,  i have become used to the screen appearance and like the way that this protector works
1	to be honest ,  i m pretty neutral about these
1	even if you only use it to dice garlic ,  it is worth owning
1	this is a very nice pepper grinder in a sea of junk grinders
1	it works great for reheating soup or making instant oatmeal
1	and is the best quality cast iron cookware made
1	great coffee maker and very easy to use
1	this cup set lets you see the size with ease thanks to the larger number on the handle ! 
1	it s actually num_num cents cheaper now in num_num than it was when i bought it in num_extend
1	first i like that the whole chassis is stainless steel
1	practical and ingenious ,  we use it all the time
1	this one is ,  but it ll wear away the nonstick properties faster ,  so handwashing is recommended
1	i love cast iron and this is my go to pot for baking my crusty bread
1	it s much cheaper to buy your first items in a kit ,  rather than individually
1	the size of the pan was perfect ,  and i was also pleased with the roasting rack included
1	it recharges quickly and i make sure it s always ready to go
1	these arrived and are a little short but they work perfectly
1	it was very helpful to have the number of cups needed for each pan plainly described on the packaging
1	these make nice gifts that won t break the bank
1	keep in mind that it is slow so plan on charging overnight with it
1	i will not have my iphone until april
1	after several drops the case has yet to come flying off as many of the hard cases do
1	i won t take a star away just for preference
1	i own several timers and this is my favorite
1	works perfectly and much better than non htc charger on my hct phone
1	the audio is great and people never complain about not hearing me
1	excellent num_extend stars instead of num_num because of the price
1	it s also a bit heaver then normal headphones because of the batteries
1	this is one that the quality was just as sweet as the quantity
1	we all can use one charger instead of having multiple chargers all over the place
1	i bought this for my motorola droid num_extend
1	i like the dual plug in style on the charger that includes usb access
1	it turns out that making yogurt is easy; just follow the included directions
1	everyone loves this juicer ,  and they are easy to use and clean
1	that s just the nature of cast iron cookware
1	the disposal cup is large enough and easy to empty and reinstall on the vacuum
1	it has never failed to open what i needed opened
1	i recommend them to anyone needing great value for the money
1	i bought this otterbox case because the defender is too bulky
1	i bought this because it happened to be top rated based off a youtube video i saw
1	all of my reviews on the chicago metallic bakeware are going to look much the same
1	and the steel just didn t conduct the heat to my satisfaction
1	it took num_num hours to bring it to full charge the ipad num_num was at num_num percent capacity
1	otherwise i can find no fault with the cup
1	i do have a few scratches on the protector screen ,  but that s what its there for
1	zucchini ,  cucumbers ,  cabbage ,  sweet potatoes ,  etc you can t feed faster the chute faster than this machine can work
1	this is compact ,  and does a good job of grinding
1	i bought these gloves so that i could use an iphone when it s cold
1	this was a cheap solution to my problem
1	arrived undamaged and no broken wire like other reviewers stated
1	love it ! we ve used it to grind from french press to cappuccino ,  without a hitch
1	it is principally the same machine reguardless of who s name is on it
1	i use it mainly for preparing coffee beans for storage

1	i have used this while sitting in a deer stand charging num_num iphones
1	this shaker is all glass and stainless steel
1	it replaces parchment paper and it is washable and reusable

1	within a year the plastic tube on the shredding disk began to break
1	my old krups made great ,  hot coffee; i was hoping the cuisinart would also
1	yes it s a pain ,  but this is what s necessary when you must always be connected
1	if you wear glasses like me you want high end quality sound and mic then this is your headset
1	it reminds me of my grandma and my childhood days on the farm
1	the amazon description says this charger is rated for num_extend but the label on the charger says num_extend
1	i had ozarka deliver water to my family and it was getting to expensive
1	i m not very good at these things so i m sure others who are handy had a much easier time
1	access to the volume and power buttons is not at all obstructed
1	also ,  they re not quite as large or easy to load as my canvas bag
1	after all ,  it is the kettle that could perform on all the necessary levels
1	it works amazingly and stands up to a lot of abuse
1	two minutes in my microwave and i have a big bowl of popcorn
1	i bought this item to listen to much while i ran
1	i did use the bare floor attachment and actually prefer to clean the bare floors not using it
1	it cooks everything evenly and it gets that perfectly done color
1	noisy ,  but not as bad as some overall :  well built and a great product for the money
1	that stand is locked in there quite well
1	but the cut of the blade was impressive !  a good buy especially for as much as we use it
1	so there s a guessing game in that regard as well  
1	they really don t get a lot of use because they re just a little too small
1	for normal phone tasks ,  the boxwave works great
1	i have been frustrated with the treo num_extend because of its low quality external speaker

1	if you are a good cook ,  i d be willing to bet you ll love this pan ,  too
1	in addition to the clip ,  there is an additional loop that can be snapped around your belt
1	two pulses in one direction and one or two in the other direction gets most of the jobs done
1	i love the big round cookies it makes also ,  they come out in perfect uniform size every time
1	this product is awesome !  the previous reviews about the sturdiness of this product ,  i found was very wrong
1	this device does both of those actions quickly

1	i purchased the lenox  holiday nouveau  num_extend round tablecloth to coordinate with several lenox holiday nouveau serving pieces

1	this is great to have on hand and a fun thing to do with kids or grandchildren
1	this is exactly the same as the one it replaced and works perfectly
1	much more workable for me in our apartment than an outdoor barbeque
1	my iphone num_extend connected instantly the first time i turned this on
1	although this case is called  rubberized ,   it more of a hard plastic case with a soft surface feel
1	it does not rotate in every direction like the comparably priced starbucks machine
1	thanks amazon and the manufacturer for good packing and quick shipping
1	charges quickly  but since it s going to be there while you re asleep ,  speed shouldn t matter too much 
1	on it s high heat setting ,  it uses only num_num watts
1	as long as you have a microwave ,  you ll need one of these
1	this butter dish easily stores a standard sized quarter pound stick of butter with room to spare
1	this cord has been put through the wringer with my iphone num_num and it still works num_extend years later
1	i believe the free rpm is about num_num and num_num amps on the xt
1	at the highest its about what a normal phone is at its middle setting
1	the resultant edges are smooth enough not to easily cut you
1	backlight would make it perfect      sound quality is pretty good ,  though not great
1	calphalon has become my favorite brand of cookware
1	the lg optimus v  part of the one series  is an excellent starter phone for android
1	overall ,  i got exactely what i expected which is perfect
1	i searched long and hard to find a quality charger for my phone
1	the space bag does take some effort to use since you have to roll the air out
1	ok ,  this is like the third time i have rated this
1	it s effective  clear  range is appx num_num feet
1	it does an excellent job for a hand sharpener ,  and it is very convenient to carry
1	as time goes on ,  i see num_num circles of dust showing up on the tulle
1	these were significantly cheaper than the cast aluminum pan
1	who ever designed this did a bang up job a good looking sleek design and looks futheristic
1	i like being able to attach it to my belt or just hang it on my pants pocket
1	i love my knives and this is fast becoming a favorite
1	this pan is the perfect size for my household
1	it is protective too !  when mine wears out if it does  i will buy another ! 
1	this makes that particular part difficult to clean
1	the grease channel has to be dumped ,  kind of messey with a hot griddle
1	my experience with steak has not been good and i need to experiment more
1	no damages to it and no fading color after my extensive use and changes
1	the first is a two piece hard shell that snaps around the ipod
1	the can opener ,  also cuts down on effort
1	you can use itunes or windows media to sort of organize your stuff on the phone itself
1	this would be good for a single person ,  college student ,  or small family
1	otherwise this works amazingly well in a variety of different sized pots
1	they are good looking ,  not cheap or flimsy ,  and the mill works perfectly
1	plastic very sturdy and holds up well to the microwave heat
1	we have the older model of these delonghi radiator heaters from a relative
1	it hugs the phone tight enough that many people won t know you have a case on it
1	i also found that it had a pretty long battery life
1	i store this item in the freezer with the attachments so its ready to go when i am
1	i am using a rooted and modded inspire num_extend
1	the sound quality is awesome for me and callers ,  some say too good
1	he tells me it is by far the best one he has ever used
1	we totally love its versibility to mount is various areas
1	i suggest you give it as a gift
1	i bought this springform pan based on the recommendation of several trusted sources ,  including cook s illustrated magazine
1	this kitchenaid unit was purchased to make ice cream
1	it s easy to keep the set shiny if you use the steel wool soap pads once a while
1	it is so thin and light you barely realize it s on the phone
1	probably should not have purchased as fried foods are not good for you but they taste good
1	haha  trust me i learned from experience i was a blackberry user for years ,  and i never wanted to switch
1	i use them for my fish tanks with my salts ,  buffers and chemicals
1	in that time ,  i ve managed to drop my phone several times
1	i love this blue tooth !  i ve had several over the years and i finally decided o try again
1	the cable the samsung facinate comes with allways came loose
1	the size is nice ,  comes with cables and adapters or just use your current usb cable
1	i use to make my tea in big quantities since i drank so much
1	handles are actually a bit longer than the blade but that is the novelty
1	those types of microphones are great for popstars ,  but i prefer a headset that is a little less noticeable
1	i needed something unbreakable for my daughter s bathroom ,  but also wanted something reasonably attractive and this fit the bill
1	it is secure enough that i could probably go jogging with it and not fall out
1	i have another set from different brand but these are my favorites
1	we cook hamburgers ,  steaks ,  hot sandwiches ,  the possibilites are nearly endless
1	i do agree with the other statements about the container being a bit on the cheap side
1	they are great for placing baking goods on when they come out of the oven
1	depending on what you use them for ,  they should last for many years
1	i foresee the vacuum being released like the other reviewers mentioned
1	a little more work to clean up after
1	i have a  yuck  glass top stove and need to make bone broth on a regular basis
1	i attempted the electrical tape fix i ve seen on youtube ,  but it did not work
1	also ,  a little indicator will come on saying  time s up  ,  and the counter start to count up
1	i have owned my machne for over a decade and haven t had the slightest problem with it
1	i d had non stick fry pans up until now ,  they worked fine ,  nothing wrong with them
1	i m hoping it does not develop a rust issue ,  who knows
1	this is probably the best bb for the money
1	much better price than williams sonoma and other high end cooking shops
1	due to this efficiency ,  it is recommended that cooking with cast iron is done on low to medium heat
1	i took my standard bundt cake recipe and cut it in half ,  and it was perfect for this pan
1	this juicer is a monster ,  it will juice anything you through down the tube
1	i have two small children ,  perhaps enough said but
1	keep charged batteries for spares when your battery goes dead
1	i really enjoy these with my wok cooking
1	this is a plastic shamppoer and the pieces dont install well
1	use small amounts and use the shake method after salting
1	i hang the from a hook in the kitchen
1	as mentioned ,  the mesh is fine enough that only the tiniest tea leaf particles get through
1	it keeps you connected in your vehicle and with it you really are on the go ! 
1	it is a very sturdy batter bowl and it will last years to come
1	because of my mistake ,  the dough rose too much and eventually collapsed on itself
1	if you use just a coffee cup or mug ,  be sure not to overfill the reservoir
1	i am going to try and interrupt the cycle to make pizza dough
1	another plus is that it is reasonably light for its size
1	the icarrier is another well built battery by them
1	very nice sauce pan i used yesterday all the long and it was easy to clean
1	it took me a few applications before i got good at it
1	for the price ,  i doubt you can find a better carving knife
1	when juicing ,  the motor is loud ,  but seems a lot quieter than other juicers i ve heard
1	i put this in a upstairs room to circulate the air up there
1	rezound  ,  the thunderbolt s screen is noticeably wider and negligibly shorter
1	riveted handles are exceptionally strong ,  but make the pot a bit harder to clean
1	it has increased my water intake easily a hundred fold
1	but i have other spatulas for when i need a straight edge
1	i always clean it after using and add a layer of cooking oil to keep it nice
1	no worries there !  my phone and ipod were taken care of thanks to this battery
1	this headset was purchased to replace a jabra num_extend
1	so ,  he started using on grill at home and had to purchase another for glamping
1	con :  nonepro :  it contains a sturdy yet beautiful cutting board
1	it is beautiful with a smooth ,  shiny finish
1	well worth the money ,  and perhaps nail polish could replace the markings that wear off ? 
1	i had ordered two swatters because a friend had complained about his old swatter
1	coffee had to change the design of the tea maker and the new pitchers are squatter
1	i bought one of these mixers several months ago and have used it extensively
1	we have been using it for almost num_num years ,  with sharpening in between
1	the phone began to freeze on phone calls and camera gallery
1	the num_extend uses a regular sim so swapping this sim isn t possible without this adapter
1	it is very nice comes with a car charger and an aux
1	i ve only done one cake in it so far ,  but had no problems with it sticking or cooking unevenly
1	i love this !  i was a little upset that when i received it ,  it was broken
1	the same goes for beef and pork roasts
1	if you like guacomole or margaritas   this is for you
1	i use it when i clean the outside refrig
1	i expect to use these dishes for the rest of my life
1	this is my third attempt at a thermal carafe
1	i m amazed that i never get any unpopped kernels ,  as i did with microwave bags
1	i use this vent mount with my samsung galaxy nexus and my ipod
1	i had to season the press ,  but that was easy
1	the plantronics  audio num_num usb stereo headset is good quality for a compact headset
1	with the glass lid i can see if the liquid is all absorbed with out letting the steam out
1	i can still connect power cord at bottom and speaker cable at top fine
1	we also used it in our barbecue and surprise it worked great ,  so so easy to clean
1	if you are in need of one ,  this would be a good choice
1	it can also be pressed into service as a last line of defense
1	i bought this toaster about a month ago and i am very pleased with it
1	like i said ,  it is not really steam
1	more important ,  she speaks clearly and eloquently ,  pronouncing names with a natural voice
1	then i made a cup where i tightly tamped my espresso ground coffee into the filter container
1	this will clean out the intake tube and prevent the dribbling as the num_num star poster mentioned
1	it is very sharp ad makes peeling very easy
1	it gives a little extra room to work ,  and fits nicely on my oven rack
1	keep the phone clean and had no problem with it
1	my num_extend fits perfectly with the protective skin on it
1	i bought it because it is the meat pounder alton brown recommended
1	the domed lid is perfect to keep things from splattering
1	i use these in my overhead flexible four inch system for dust control
1	i am very happy with my purchase and highly suggest it to anyone who needs a mixer
1	i have purchased other soup mugs ,  but this is the one for me
1	this machine works well for me and is a breeze to clean
1	i just wipe them off with a damp cloth to clean
1	some people bash the back battery cover which is a thin plastic cover
1	i recommend it to all of my friends that have carpet
1	volume buttons are a little hard to get to but not to bad
1	this slicer is so sharp and very easy to use for my tendinitis wrist
1	wow ,  for the price it s a really good cable
1	these are great screen protecters and look very nice
1	typical that something so good and so long lasting ,  is not available any longer
1	these kitchen shears rock and are in heavy rotation in my kitchen
1	we re impressed with this line and are likely to buy more
1	these classic knifes are exactly what i expected
1	bench press ,  sit ups ,  etc   these sets would be perfect
1	i don t have that fear with the vent mounting
1	update :  obviously i caved in and got the num_extend anyway
1	a good cell phone ,  but absolutely no peripheral features  the good :  very clear voice qualities ,  acceptable speaker phone function
1	i have purchased glass lids for many of my pots ,  etc
1	i discover a filter above the dirt canister and it was clogged
1	the glass protectors are catching on ,  check one out
1	and they were all cheeply made and they could not afford a real good made one
1	they are fabulous and indespensable if you are a cook
1	i bought this item for me ,  my grandson and yes even my cats
1	this is really a great buy for about $
1	after buying what seemed like every ice cream scoop on the market ,  we finally found perfection
1	they get a lot of wear ,  so i buy them two at a time
1	once you use this one you will never go back to pounding your meat with anything else
1	i had solid ones before with no rollers
1	i like to make water with fruit in it
1	whoever posted that it was too light was just trying to pull our chain
1	the discount cards for places like cvs ,  walgreens ,  etc 
1	would highly recommend for anyone wanting to grill inside
1	recommended for anyone who wants to save money
1	the handle is shorter than my regular pans ,  and the handle can get very hot during cooking
1	bought for use in making cocoa ,  french onion soup and to microwave without the handles getting hot
1	it saves trips back and forth to the kitchen if we re spending time outside
1	it keeps the square shape of the iphone without being too bulky
1	not protective only stylish but it wasnt intenedeintended to protect my case for me only for cute
1	the rolled top edge makes it easy on the hands when cutting mulitple cookies etc
1	but ,  hey what do you expect for a num_num mah beast
1	if not for this ,  i d have given it five stars
1	it s non nonstick ,  but it s not very sticky and it cleans up very easily by hand
1	so the best option is to buy the cheap cases that she can do that with
1	the long handle makes it top heavy when trying to rest it somewhere
1	there are far more positive reviews than negative reviews ! 
1	thanks so very much for an awesome case
1	other than that ,  this vacuum is great for apartment dwellers and people who live in small living places
1	it dust doesn t have the width to turn those bigger items well
1	i cut up a ziploc bag and used it for the bottom and top and pressed another tortilla out
1	i am very picky about my morning coffee and am willing to pay to have a quality machine
1	this pressure cooker is a welcome addition to my kitchen
1	there are also belt loops but i have not used them yet
1	if you make big batches ,  get a big cuisinart
1	i can t wait to get home and try the bagel dough recipe
1	makes a good cup of coffee and does it reasonably quickly
1	it fits perfectly and i like how it is hugs my phone
1	i like the design too ,  so i have enjoyed drinking out of them
1	great buy !  i love to decorate my bb
1	this one will be coming out much more frequently
1	the smaller plates are great for toast in the mornings
1	we were so happy that amazon carried this
1	when i told them the bargain ,  they asked me to order for them
1	hope this helps someone get a better idea of the product
1	i bought this as my wife has developed a taste for guacamole dip
1	i don t cut raw meat on the boards ,  and ocassionally ,  i wash my boards in a little bleach water
1	it hasn t really proved problematic ,  as the touch response doesn t seem to be affected ,  but it s a little awkward
1	if you put it back on your warm stove ,  it helps dry it more quickly
1	thinking of ordering some as gifts for my friends who also have iphones
1	not really enough to leave a huge residue but a puff
1	it s a great product for a great price !  !  !  cant beat it !  !  ! 
1	easy install ,  hold great on bumpy roads and i havent had any noises or vibrations
1	glass is thick and durable and fits nicely in the wire frame
1	it was the correct item and was delivered within num_num days of order being placed
1	very good price also as the same item at verizon costs almost num_extend
1	it s a phone charger for the motorola razor ,  and guess what ?  it works for it
1	i hear it works well ,  but i don t have the experience myself ,  therefore i can t give first hand experience
1	i unscrewed the fuse cap to reveal a tiny glass type fuse
1	they wash up easily ,  and the plastic container is perfect for storage
1	this one is so much better than the cheap types i ve subjected myself to in the past
1	a plastic blade guard would be a nice addition
1	couldnt be that much harder to add it
1	cheaper then what s in the store ,  and seems to be working fine
1	bought these to fight the glare from lights and being outside
1	i am very hard on my dishes and have been using corelle for years because of it
1	took me two tries but they work nicely
1	plus i ve found it to be very accurate
1	just this one product and cakes and breads pop out of their pan perfectly
1	my fiancee picked it out and she loves it
1	use plastic wrap or simple napkin over them and no problems
1	bought as a gift after having the griffin num_extend amps car charger
1	it s pretty thin so just take care of it
1	but back to the stand mixer ,  it is worth every penny for this kitchenaid
1	now that i have them all back ,  i m good to go ! 
1	i will keep an eye out for more to add to my collection
1	i keep one in the car and others in the charging drawer at the house
1	this is as good as you can get for a dollar less screen protector
1	they clean up in the dishwasher easily too
1	i bought a different brand i have owned this model for several years
1	thanks to amazon ,  i can find a replacement at any time of the year
1	very happy with this new addition to my kitchen
1	it doesn t plug directly into the iphone so you will need to also carry a charging cord
1	it worked great in my car and charged my phone quickly
1	these were ok ,  didn t like real small ones
1	it s easy to install due to the slight stretch in the plastic
1	how i don t know first i sent an email to sf planet via amazon com
1	have used filter pitchers and this is much easier to use
1	my next test is going to be a small pork or beef roast with baby potatoes ,  carrots and onions
1	the straight sides allow for a cake that will be even and beautiful
1	the background noise cancellation on this thing is the top of the line
1	the problem is that my family seems to go through screen protectors like candy
1	he does not run or profusely sweat in these ,  so i cannot attest to the moisture durability
1	the three wand attachments are great for their specified purposes
1	fits neatly over your appliance with smoothly contoured lines
1	my phone runs hot while charging ,  however it does charge
1	other cloths i have purchased in the past were of such low quality that they were ,  in essence ,  disposable
1	it makes a perfect cheesecake and now i m planning on ordering another one
1	all you have to to is clear the cache
1	unfortunately ,  i only have regular applecare ,  not applecare plus  plus only started recently 
1	any case with even a hint of silicone ,  makes it a difficult task to extract from my pocket
1	i am tall so i do not have the problem some other reviewers have had of seeing the gauge
1	i love cooking in my iron skillet ,  it gives a much better flavor to food
1	the day it came in i made french fries and they came out crisp and great
1	i like that the cord can be concealed in the base
1	but since i got this one ,  it s the only one i use
1	i have used two out of the three knives ,  first remember the set is under $ for the set
1	however you want to get that ,  its up to you
1	it is very sturdy and i love the idea of no gaskets to deal with
1	the footprint is almost as big as the processor ,  but it easily fits in the cabinet
1	the guard stays put for a long time
1	i was actually pretty impressed with the sound quality of these headphones
1	just wanted to say i was pleasantly surprised when i received this today
1	we looked at several of these devices to gut a pineapple
1	after years of constant use it shows no sign of dulling
1	it is so convenient we ll live with that issue
1	she says it protects her phone from being damaged if she drops it
1	i changed my kitchen to white canister ,  coffee pot ,  etc
1	a sony ericcson may be the phone for you
1	juicer looks great ,  and is very well made
1	as mentioned earlier the item arrived as stated and the price was very excellent
1	i live in an apartment and did not want the fire alarm going off
1	when i first ordered i was nervous bc this product was supposed to be compatible with iphone
1	the price of the item well surpasses any hangups one might have
1	the contents will then cool very quickly try this bowl to cool down custard when you are filling pastries
1	this is one of those items that delivers everything it promises
1	thought enough of them that we bought another set for a gift and the friend likes them too
1	they are heavy duty and i put hot items on them with no problems
1	love this pan for cooking for a crowd or making sheet cakes
1	this steamer has two compartments which will hold enough veggies for a family of num_extend
1	even the flash works well and doubles nicely as a flashlight + battery life
1	either they do not fit properly ,  or they do not last
1	this one is being used at least weekly
1	even my son who is a boy scout loves it to sharpen his scout knife
1	however ,  it is a bit difficult to clean
1	you just have to make sure you pack down the grounds lightly before brewing
1	i was a bit skeptical of the practicality of this
1	love this dinnerware ,  have had a complete set for about num_num years and they are still in great condition
1	it fits perfect over the buttons and no gaps around the edge so far
1	it fits snuggly around both the num_num and the num_extend and slides in and out of my pocket
1	make the bread crumbs for my chicken supremes or chicken kiev ?  check ,  check ,  and check
1	i m dieting so i use an airpopper a lot
1	i could drive and get coffee faster than that
1	the machine was perfect  ,  it works like a dream
1	you need to balance size ,  cost and power
1	for this and for the unmatched service i recieved  without even contacting them  ,  i would highly recommend this product
1	however ,  i m told there is significant noise at highway speed
1	the charger worked fine for a month ,  then just stopped working
1	your phone is protected without a lot of additional bulk
1	bought one for myself ,  then had to buy a second one because my girlfriend stole my first
1	this is a fine mug for teachers ,  business people etc
1	i ve used these numerous times ,  and have issues only because i m kinda tough on a phone
1	i got one of these batteries from oem planet via the amazon com marketplace
1	the caveat is that it only works if you insert the device as shown in the photos
1	the tea is still burn your mouth hot
1	i look at my kitchen stuff almost like a pet lol
1	i like to make very large batches of soup
1	they have been dropped ,  dented and scratched and still they continue to be my favorite bowls
1	the knife blades slide in and protects the blade
1	i moved into the suburbs where the water is so much better
1	practice with it a bit though ,  it can splash out if you have an odd shaped bottle
1	works well ,  keeps things moving smoothly ,  and helps to keep clean up faster
1	i m not sure if that s my area or the phone itself
1	it is fairly fragile and can break easily ,  so use caution when handling it
1	i use it as a decoration in my kitchen because the wood is so pretty
1	it can be a bit of pain using potholders to pick them up with the eggs inside
1	i want a kitchen stocked with beautifully feeling and looking ,  plus perfectly functionally designed kitchen tools
1	it moves air quite fast for its size
1	this is an awesome product ,  if only in appearance
1	excited because the post office ,  not amazon ,  lost  or stole  my package
1	the only downfall is the distant between iphone and headset is way less than advertised
1	can t wait for mine to arrive so i could enjoy using it too
1	the price was reasonable ,  included shipping and the back arrived four days after i ordered it including a weekend
1	there is no use using the call function in anything but the quietest settings
1	we ve had this pan for a few years now
1	still ,  knowing what i know now i would purchase it again
1	this little brewer is much better for brewing my own coffee and easier to clean
1	however i wish the sides were a bit higher on the outside
1	it holds up to twelve and a half ounces ,  five ounces more than the regular hand soap dispensers
1	it is curved and it helps shape the loaf
1	i originally got this product because i wanted a stylus for my ipad to mark up documents
1	this is not just for paella and mussels
1	if you use your fido jars a lot ,  you will eventually need a pack of these
1	this product is only glass digitizer ,  not the plastic holder underneath of it
1	i would recommend this paddle to any of my friends
1	so i am experimenting with taking filling out
1	i especially love the built in strainers in the lid
1	you can never have too many usb chargers
1	the quality for the price of this pan is awesome
1	the fact that it is not non stick allows for better cooking ,  deglazing ,  carmelizing ,  searing ,  etc
1	bought a second popper recently so we could produce more perfect popcorn at once
1	if you re going to by a manual citrus juice press ,  buy this one
1	though this product lacks class it does fit its function and purpose which is for ice tea
1	i read a lot of reviews on this before i forked out the cash
1	washes reall nice in the dishwasher with no discoler attion
1	elegant enough to impress guests ,  but sturdy and functional for everyday use
1	very small footprint on the counter as well
1	however ,  the baker in the family will want a nice clean silpat for her christmas cookies
1	really nice ,  sturdy measuring cups with good grips
1	gotta love black goes with everything ,  and of course it s the only color men want to have
1	they promptly responded that it was ,  and when the battery arrived ,  it was indeed a real motorola
1	have been needing one for awhile and decided to buy this one
1	this is a very nice case  ,  it fits just right and it closes and opens nicely
1	unlocked phones  carrier unlocked  do not require  activation  and will take any gsm sim  standard size 
1	the best thing about this is that food doesn t stain the inside
1	for the average kitchen i suspect this would last a lifetime
1	this was a great replacement for our bodum french press
1	my old charger s cable was flimsy and it stopped working right when bent in a certain position
1	saves your hands from getting cut and lids dropping in your food
1	i can put salad veggies in here together and they all come out uniformly
1	anyway ,  if you need the right angle ,  then it will be a num_num star review for you
1	this extended battery was excellent ,  price and product   can t be beat
1	so in the future we will share one
1	they make the water taste much better and help rid the water of nasty things
1	what were they thinking ?  so glad i could still find the digital display foreman
1	as usual ,  take care not to slip ,  because the points are fine ,  and will easily shred flesh
1	it is sleek looking and it cleans up very well
1	using it to charge my galaxy num_extend right now
1	i was using a griffin unit that has buttons instead of motion sensing to control the iphone
1	i have a french press that i ve been using at work ,  and the coffee is delicious and consistent
1	having had cheaper large pots ,  i steered away from buying this expensive pot
1	it fell and scooped right underneath the egg
1	were it not for my glasses ,  it would be perfect
1	i purchased these form amazon in num_num and we are still using them on a daily basis
1	only thing when it gets dropped it gets a bit scratched up on the corners
1	one gratin recipe called for num_num grated potatoes
1	little by little ,  i am learning to make our food from scratch
1	these are hard to find in local stores
1	i must say that i love every one of them
1	i can t say enough good things about this great lid
1	this reduces the suction which is critical in removing as much water from the carpet as possible
1	as a household with just two people ,  i find that the medium sized loaf is perfect for us
1	i wish it would just beep until i shut it off
1	they also appear to be better made and more durable
1	i absolutely love this thing !  !  !  !  !  !  i used to have the mr
1	they are tools we will keep mario s ,  and move biff s measuring tools to the camping supplies
1	all the rest is good the phone is terrific as a phone
1	this extends the use and life of the board and i think it s a shame to take that away
1	my very first cup was heaven ,  i ve never experienced such a robust ,  wonderful coffee
1	but once in a while ,  a large skillet is called for ,  and this one is perfect
1	it does have the cool v handle and i look forward to many years of use
1	so i don t worry about warping or discoloration of the handle
1	and i love it !  ! is easy to use and handles big batches of anything i want to make
1	this mitt is thick enough to protect your hands but not so thick that you can t feel the handle
1	if you prefer russets ,  cut them in half or even quarters
1	i made my favorite apricot brandy pound cake in it and it has never looked or tasted so good
1	found a good price on amazon and it included free shipping ,  couldn t go wrong
1	we use this every morning making our espresso
1	is it the closest i found for fit ,  volume ,  clarity out and in etc ?  absolutely
1	you can use it to rest ,  flatbreads on it ,  too
1	this charger works well considering it is not an actually apple product
1	the color is more vibrant that the picture and makes it easy to find in my purse
1	the screen protector is a nice feature as well no complaints ! 
1	keeps food warm and i am using it regularly
1	all of my other tongs don t hold the food as well
1	does exactly what you would expect it to do
1	i gave it num_num stars because i had to return the first on
1	this pair from calphalon has good tension ,  not too tight or loose ,  and are comfortable in your hand
1	i m very excited about using this attachment with my old kitchenaid mixer that i bought back in num_extend
1	but as the unit bumped and moved along ,  i was quite amazed at the cleaning power of the roomba
1	lids fit perfect after several washings in the dishwasher top shelf 
1	i took a key to it and it still looks great
1	music and speech are rendered really ,  really well
1	you will ask yourself how did i ever live without this great mixer
1	i ve has the num_extend model for num_num months and it is great
1	unlike some people who use this water for only cooking purposes  , i drink this water and love it
1	the surface is  rubberized  so it won t slip in your hands
1	easy desgin ,  just slip your finger in and it slices through the peel
1	however ,  if you re in the middle of cooking something ,  this can be a quandary
1	for him ,  he gets a dessert ,  a veg ,  a salad and a main
1	riedel is one of the tests that is easy for even beginning drinkers to see the difference in
1	when you let it cool on it s own ,  that is part of the actual cooking time with the pressurization
1	keeps our counters looking more neat and organized
1	hard to tell ,  however ,  when measuring water or other clear liquids
1	i use it everyday and its been great
1	this headset is exactly as described by the manufacturer
1	my husband has num_num cup of french press in the mornings
1	the juice tastes delicious and the consistency is smooth with a perfect amount of juicy foam at the top
1	great for slicing where surface tension is high and inner stability threatened
1	as far as the filters on all the brands ,  they are basically charcoal based
1	having the right tools makes any task easier
1	we ve had it almost num_num months and it still works like the day we got it
1	perfect ,  well build and also perfectly fit all kinds of gismoz
1	the case sacrificed itself  the top corner cracked  but i d rather replace a num_extend case over a num_extend iphone
1	this juicer does a good job making this drink which i really can t make in the vitamix
1	i cconsidered replacing it with the bosch universal plus but instead went with this kitchenaid pro num_extend
1	great cookware you can keep a pot of chili or pasta sauce simmering without scorching for hours
1	ok ,  i m with everybody when it comes to this tray
1	it heats fast and is very efficient in heating
1	to be fair ,  i ve only tried a couple of bluetooth headsets ,  but this is definitely not a disappointment
1	they work great and especially for frying chicken to searing steaks
1	thank goodness for amazon !  i found the exact match
1	we got this after our old beater began to flake off
1	the stones were easy to heat in the microwave ,  and they held heat through dinner
1	besides that it has been a great case
1	a finer grind coffee will give you major flavor without having to use so much i found
1	considering the above ,  it s well worth this price
1	she loves the shade of yellow and says it is a perfect addition to her other fiesta sets
1	bought these because of plans to take cakes to fund raisers
1	this cover fits it nicely and together they do make a statement of color
1	all you have to do is pulse the food chopper until the desired size is attained
1	not too big or too small but just right
1	normally i m partial to the oxo stuff ,  but this juice press is miles better
1	it s cleared up a lot of space in my pantry and made getting to my spices much handier
1	i use them for fruit ,  mixing ,  even togo food that needs a bowl like pho ,  curry ,  etc
1	only issue is when you first put them on you have to have patience and a steady hand
1	every thing comes with it that is needed to hang it on the wall
1	i think they ll last as long as i want them around
1	and the retractable cord is also a very nice feature
1	never have found anything as good at this as these bamboo brushes    ! 
1	the unit size is nice and there is room to fry a lot of potatoes
1	we are back to buy another cordless vacuum
1	but you can use paper filters in this machine if you want to
1	it looks as good as it did when i first got it
1	great for slow cooking baby food and for dips at a great price
1	love this knife ,  a definite go to staple piece in my kitchen
1	the handle feels a little plasticky ,  and less grippy or weighted than expected
1	it s the perfect size ,  does what it needs to ,  was a good price for what i wanted
1	i wish i would have had this when i was single
1	they seem to be pretty accurate and durable as well
1	i cant believe how much hair and dust it picked up
1	bought this for my mother when her old bunn coffee maker wouldn t quit leaking
1	but i can t say that i really like popcorn without that butter
1	i thought it would dull easily or wear down ,  after all it s only $ but i was wrong
1	air vents like the ones in some of the other review pics are the ones it works with
1	it definitely takes more effort to press the button ,  but it is by no means impossible or even difficult
1	it s great because of it s heavy duty material
1	it looks good doing it too ,  though that s frankly not a consideration
1	everyone heard me clearly and i heard them clearly
1	the inside lid of the door pops off for quick cleaning , revealing the inner surface of the door with gaskets
1	the batter was so thick i had to spoon it under the support bars
1	the cradle is snapped onto the mount and is ready for use
1	work well as a serving bowl or as a soup bowl
1	i did not bother reading the directions ,  and was able to set it up easily
1	however ,  it over heats if i use it to long without a break
1	the padding is a nice touch and there is no sag in it when its hanging from the vent
1	this is a terrific item if your washer is not right near your dryer
1	the parts were perfect and fit together easily
1	i just received the num_extend screen protector and i would definitely say that it is made of good quality
1	they clean easy ,  lightweight and take no space to store upright
1	it says to replace in num_num months ,  but actually you should base this time on the rate of use
1	i used num_num grams of flour to num_num eggs for my pasta dough
1	but i wasn t that impressed with it after my first use
0	if you drop it for any reason ,  its likely broken
0	if you want an alternative to this oil ,  orofluido is much better ,  smells better and has more lasting results
0	but its probably more to do with the storage than removing the adults ! 
0	after seeing similar hoses on tv ,  i was excited to try this out
0	these did nothing special for my cats that an ordinary bed or blanket couldn t provide
0	swimming is no better because enemies can always see you and you can only hide underwater while being still
0	she s unlikely to ever scratch that part ,  especially considering how big and loud  the ball part of  it is
0	this must be done carefully or else you will dislodge the charms
0	i will never buy anything from this brand again
0	at least you can take a shower afterwards
0	and there was a huge gap that would never close and exposed a part of the phone
0	she can t walk with it becuase it either falls apart or it trips her
0	the scent is still kind of strange ,  and on your face scent definitely matters
0	indicating that a good portion of the gymnema has been cut in favor of the flour
0	normally i love love love this product but it tasted odd and i ended up throwing it all away
0	i d send it back if i could do so without paying postage
0	it is all in the marketing ,  do not fall for the hype
0	it s just burn and traumatizes your skin ,  nothing else
0	word to the wise ,  try natural remedies prior to chemical solutions ,  just might be the answer for you
0	if you want to use the shuffle or program features you have to use the menu on you tv
0	the smallest is an aggressive chewer ,  and i thought that this would be a great toy for him
0	i have to say that i am not a fan of this item
0	ergon grips move your weight to the base of your hand
0	i installed this on a mossberg num_num and stripped the threads
0	i wanted them for playing tennis but did not even get that far
0	mind you ,  i received excellent customer service from the seller ,  but the product just didn t work
0	i cannot express how embarrassing such a situation is
0	they are people who just bought the product and haven t had much experience with it
0	it also has an optical out ,  which it should
0	you mix it with num_num ounces of water and you get this bland medicine like drink out of it
0	anyways i ve been using syntha for the past two years and regret trying to go back to on
0	then it dies and you gain about num_extend xp points
0	i tried dying both my lashes and brows ,  and both were a disaster
0	i found it to time consuming to try it very often and bought the real sausage making equipment
0	it is the deep purple color of a dark purple eggplant
0	they are very thin leather with a cheap sole and probably cost about ten dollars maximum to produce
0	i knew coming in that this game wasn t going to be the madden of old
0	it can take under four hours to beat it
0	i have always dreamed of a solid bluetooth headset for my phone
0	it also uses extra num_extend from the gun to move num_num paintballs around and down to the barrel
0	then i was trying to grap the top holder
0	not sure if this was from the acid in it or something else ,  maybe the cinnamon
0	the most recently bag contained mostly smaller bully sticks that reeked terribly
0	i also thought the lace trim was itchy
0	this kettle looks pretty but doesn t turn off once it boils
0	i got ripped off and it s not worth the money or effort
0	i bought another lot thinking it was a lot problem but it was the same
0	then it finishes with a stevia after taste !  yuck
0	i personally think its because these are fanless ,  and seem to overheat very quickly
0	i bought this because of the high reviews
0	it leaks when it s level ,  and faster when it s tipped swaying in the wind
0	:  update :  i did find the directions for installation in the envelope
0	i cooked chicken and steak on it the first night and it worked okay
0	i received this product a couple days ago
0	i far exceed the suggested system ,  yet my game stuttered in the strangest ,  seemingly least demanding places
0	unhappy with it ,  actually i already replaced them
0	don t try this in a top loader ,  it will probably destroy the mat 
0	then ,  he told me that my order was being held up because there was a hurricane in the pacific
0	it was claimed that this was compatible with my panasonic cordless landline system
0	maybe you need some silocone in your hair sometimes just to be able to get a brush through it
0	it has wheat derived ingredients ,  which causes skin irritation for a lot of people
0	if the toy actually worked consistently ,  it would be great
0	i took this and could tell no difference ,  except it turns your poo the color of the box
0	i stretched the rubber band and it worked !  for num_num minutes
0	i have owned the game for quite a long time and still haven t beaten the first level by myself
0	it was very difficult to get started and keep going
0	i am a true size num_num and that s what i bought
0	i have one or two other  one star  items but many four and five star items
0	i really wanted to give this system a fair shot
0	their dmso is produced through a chemical reaction
0	however ,  it is asking to much to have only num_num installs
0	my coworker described it as;  autumn leaf red  whatever that means ,  ha
0	if you screw up you can t restart the race !  which leads me to my next num_extend backtracking
0	i have brows that are fairly thin but mostly they stop short of the average length brow
0	i ve had this unit for a few years
0	this crap is for the masses that don t know any better
0	with that said ,  the flow on this hose isn t that great and the connectors suck
0	one everything is opened ,  it is difficult to get it back inside again so i left the cup out
0	there is also a high probability that mold could form there during storage
0	crawford describes in his excellent review of this product
0	i found that one must go painfully slow to try and prevent that from happening
0	you d actually have to start a brand new game to do so
0	it started to have clicking sounds and searches would take num_num minutes; this was after num_num months of use
0	it is a novel jewelry box or trinket holder
0	i swear the triggers are sensitive to gravity
0	when you mix with your conditioner ,  you have to pour it
0	i am not computer illeterate ,  but you have to have a systems degree to install this unit
0	i have a normal width foot with a bit of a high instep ,  but this just didn t work
0	if you want spicy just go for chai
0	i think this will be really cool when some of the bugs are worked out
0	so my question is what do you want to do with it and why
0	no instructions are included ,  although it s possible to google some good sites
0	they are only num_num calories because they are unbelievably small not because they are nutritional
0	well i will blame it on this thing ,  the screws striped my rifle
0	i also tightened the tension on the perch in case birds found the springiness disconcerting
0	another parent stated that the toy is small
0	i bought the charger in june and it was broken by august
0	not my cup of tea !  but if you like spicy teas then this is for you
0	the rose flavor is the one highlight but there was not much of that in the package
0	now whenever i leave the house ,  my dogs have to be locked up
0	despite the description and the packaging ,  these gloves are not cotton flock lined
0	there is nothing special that designates that this is worth num_num dollars
0	i wish i had paid better attention before purchasing
0	so no stars deducted for that however ,  i like a body wash that lathers up well
0	to add insult to injury ,  the interface is pretty awful ,  too
0	after many hours ,  i just put the battery into the phone and it was fully charged
0	i had this on subscribe and save for a while
0	i have heard this was a good brand ,  and the video looked great
0	most aren t related to how the top is screwed on or the filter basket is latched
0	one of the internal ports is bent so i cannot plug a usb into it
0	i was disappointed since i normally like the little people toys
0	barely past the knees ,  it was extremely tight
0	i don t know why they ship the returned product as new one
0	i gave them each the recommended amount ,  waited ,  and nothing
0	we ordered several different colors and patterns ,  all by rothco
0	i am disappointed i bought the game without previewing it first
0	when i first got this item ,  it was great and had alot of fun with it
0	they do work ,  and my cats learned to stay away from the cans very quickly
0	i m sure there a method to this madness ,  but it s on , y me that cares
0	i tried it for a week ,  and now know for sure
0	sometimes this is hard when the surrounding danger gets intense ,  but most of the time it s painfully easy
0	the final death blow to the sound quality comes from the voice acting
0	i made two identical cheescakes at the same time
0	this seems to be well built ,  but i need a shoe horn to get my nexus num_num to fit
0	you d be better off with the older style that doesn t use batteries
0	people complain that the xbox version could ve been more realistic
0	i saw these recommended and hoped they d improve my digestion
0	the product was a waste of my money
0	you see ,  there are many filters in this machine
0	it was only supporting num_extend but otherwise setup was so easy
0	i realized that it s just like the original ,  just bigger
0	do this for num_num minutes and it can lower your blood pressure maybe num_num points  on top 
0	just like all the other denman brushes ,  the back of the brushes slide out
0	first ,  there are similar games with better grahpics ,  like myst
0	cheap ,  just parely covered the phone and it is hard to get onand off
0	if you put much pressure on your head while using it ,  it hurts
0	i think the little bit of pressure on the button is what caused my phone to act up
0	i m dead serious ,  the only way to attack is with missle launches
0	the ac adapter is num_extend at num_extend amps which seems to provide more than enough voltage
0	i did not notice any effect from this supplement
0	the textured  nubs  on the back of the watch are awful
0	i have acne prone skin and i was hoping that it would help clear up breakouts
0	i love adventure games and own all the originals from sierra and lucasarts
0	i didn t have a good experience with this product
0	the tines are flimsy and there are not have enough tines to be effective
0	the focus button is the only cool part of the game
0	they have the lowest price anywhere for this game
0	on one of my previous cars ,  i tried valeo num_num ultimate blades  similar to anco contour 
0	a box of num_num is like a one year supply for me
0	i use it all the time in my recliner
0	water tastes great through a brita filter ,  but this pitcher is poorly designed
0	only to discover to my horror that the cheap p o s
0	i bought this product to help even out some redness and solve mild acne
0	get the ground hogs ,  you ll get what you pay for : msr ground hog stake kit
0	i know a lot of people who have merrell s so i hope my new pair is a good fit
0	you need a flat area about two inches square ,  where you want to mount it
0	people say later you download more ,  but thats just a rumor
0	it s quick and fun and doesn t require too much thought
0	yet ,  weirdly ,  the spandex around my ankles is way too tight
0	she stated that i most likely had a refurbished unit ,  which immediately made sense
0	the main issue is that the pad is located in the wrong place
0	this thing made  notice the past tense  great popcorn
0	the set is missing a firm ,  flat brush for packing shadow onto the lid
0	the sequels never took my interest either not the best fighting game by far graphics csound cgameplay clasting appeal c+
0	it looks great ,  but don t try to move it
0	you have to build your town ,  make soldiers ,  etc
0	on my scale ,  it weighs over num_num ounces with batteries
0	this is so convenient when you want charge your extra battery
0	she played with it for about num_num hours total the first few days she received it
0	she spoke pretty good english but she was on drugs or something
0	they re packed in there so well you need to scrape them num_extend
0	but this spanx camisole was definitely not for me
0	but first and foremost ,  a gadget must work
0	i m pretty sensitive to heavily scented things and it just made my stomach turn while trying to sleep
0	i also don t care for the brown color
0	and all comes in a can the size of a red bull for num_num calories i did not like it
0	i don t want my children thinking an f is a g and q is an e
0	salicylic acid seems to be better for me for now
0	we took it apart and substituted nickles which work very well and won t break
0	after only a few months of use it is leaking from the hendle
0	i had to throw out the remaining packets after trying several
0	thank god for ritz crackers as i was then able to consume
0	the quality of desktop speakers has risen to a very high level in the last couple of years
0	we received this knife for our wedding  august num_extend
0	i am ok with gun recoil ,  and moving slow when wearing a bunch of armor
0	is indoors ,  so weather conditions do not num_extend
0	i threw away the lilac vegetal the next day
0	after giving it a week ,  i am tossing it out
0	i didn t see anything special about this one that deserves a higher price
0	i now have about num_num red bumps on my forehead that i cant get rid of
0	i have bought a lot of mascara in my day ,  and this is just like any other
0	thankfully it s under num_num days so i m returning it
0	this didn t stay in place at all for me no matter what shoes i had on
0	i also found the hover bikes to be nearly impossible to control
0	i got it set up ,  and then tried to dry some dishes in it
0	as soon as i stopped using it ,  my face stopped breaking out
0	my old compact dryer blows more air and as a result ,  is easier to use and style with
0	i ve been buying bali products for num_num years and this is my first complaint
0	i have a strict skincare regimen and when i heard all of the reviews and how its so great
0	apple needs to understand that their ipods  designs are flawed
0	units have horrible pathing and no sort of structure
0	so basically your buying a cheap coffee maker with a good carafe
0	i was not really impressed with this sprayer
0	so save your dough ,  buy any color but red diva s !  !  !  !  what can i say ? 
0	my characters started moving by themselves   planes started flying themselves
0	it turns out this battery only has a capacity of num_extend and i am feeling very ripped off
0	received one of these as a gift ,  but wouldn t let the puppy eat it after checking the ingredients
0	the taste was bitter and sharp ,  not smooth and had a yucky  fake  taste
0	on the whole the gameplay tries to deliver an adequate amount of mayhem
0	the side with the coconut oil had better texture ,  tightening and my skin looked a lot more readiant
0	i wish i had of researched more before my purchase of this
0	is there a cartoon with these characters ?  i wasn t familiar with these little critters before getting this set
0	its sensitivity reminds me of asa num_num speed film
0	saeco was very responsive back then and picked up the machine and repaired it promptly
0	it s bulky and heavy to move ,  yet made out of flimsy plastic
0	so i know his size these were either missed marked or num_extend or something
0	maybe designed to fit num_extend not num_extend do not line up either
0	but that s a bit expensive ,  so just look around
0	it s so small i didn t even see it for what it was
0	we rated this lower because of what we like in a game
0	these ,  however ,  were not the typical high quality i m used to with this company they felt thinner and very cheap ! 
0	she rarely played with it after the novelty wore off
0	in my trip ,  my daughter and i eventually took turns to carry the bag
0	i do not want the hassle of returning item but the quality of the wheels are cheap ,  cheap ,  cheap
0	i returned these cause the fit and the look of them didn t suit me
0	description needs to state the size of the adapter
0	num_num day things were good then my peas disappeared
0	these are cheap head phones and the style isn t too bad since they are flat to the ears
0	i bought these on impulse as they were on sale
0	do not get magnetic ones you ll just wasted your money
0	your objective now is to find a way back home  how creative 
0	my old ms optical mouse never had any problems
0	i purchased thinking this would be a fun indoor activity
0	comparing the two they don t look the same as the one listed in the picture either
0	bought this for my daughter and i have seen balloons bigger than this thing
0	this stuff is not cheap and this brand doesn t work as a sweetener ,  in my opinion
0	i don t know how that slot will affect the temperature holding ability of the thermal pot
0	she will get frustrated with the hair and give up
0	they are not the tasty treat of the past and these were made in different country
0	as an alternative ,  i recommend taking a multivitamin with a glass of water
0	this clear one had the power button break within days
0	and even then ,  i would replay the former titles again before sending buying this one
0	i tasted a small amount before feeding it to my daughter and determined that it was ,  indeed ,  bad
0	so ,  then i went to target and very carefully looked at the brushes and determined that they were genuine
0	must be something cheap from china ,  so i tossed it
0	yes they are attractive ,  i love the simple lines and the curve at the bottom
0	i followed the instructions and hung it in an area well populated with yellow jackets
0	i had a frame fit silca as well as a zefal in the past
0	out of all of the stray hairs on my brows ,  only three were removed with these strips
0	the programmers make sure that you have hardly any life before you reach the end
0	the product has nothing on the label to help you know what is in it
0	hey it s been a while since i used this
0	you better point the device right at the ir port on your camera
0	after one day the adjustment dial began to come away from wristband
0	nowhere on the page did i see that this is a vegetarian product
0	this is especially evident during cutscenes when you are required to operate the controls
0	if it were good ,  my kids would probably drink num_num at a sitting
0	it is a very nice and cute pan but i will not start out with damaged goods
0	i just purchased this one ,  and after num_extend use ,  cut my finger
0	these are made in china and you can draw your own conclusions
0	mounted on my benjamin np ,  would not hold position
0	i opened the box ,  set up the pool  very easy and began filling
0	it s fast ,  convenient ,  and a healthy start to the day
0	my wife was unable to operate it we cleaned it up and she returned it today
0	the kids are not basically making up what they do as they go along
0	she does seem to like the merrick bg dry food
0	we got it out of the box and it looked fine
0	that s what makes this game so damn frustrating and boring
0	i ve tried adjusting the volume to see if that would help ,  no such luck
0	great cleaner ,  but num_num stars for the bottle design
0	stick to creapure monohydrate if you want a good source of creatine
0	do not buy !  do not use !  unnatural color
0	this is a genuinely useless product ,  at least as far as squirrels are concerned
0	my num_extend did not work ,  as the other person could not hear me ,  although i could hear them
0	organcs smaller sized than regular but i find that to be true on most organics ,  which is quite acceptable
0	i thought it was me ,  and i didnt remember what it was supposed to be like
0	at it best it puffs and goes out like the candle on a birthday cake
0	please ignore those reviewers who played a game or two and said this game was great
0	i really never understood the craze of this game
0	i recently bought this card to add on to my hp desktop computer
0	my computer crashed recently and took the hard drive with it
0	fortunately ,  i opened the bag and poured it out in a bowl before eating any
0	clean design with an easy to read dial
0	i wish they carried reliable products ,  but they ,  like i thought it was a superior brand
0	i finished the num_num oz glass ,  but soon after began to feel nauseous
0	i bought this based on all the reviews i read here
0	what a piece of junk !  !  !  !  i had high hopes for this iron after reading all the good reviews
0	incredibly worthless and complex drm that ruins thepoint of owning the num_extend
0	the adhesive doesn t work at all ,  and so you ll need to glue them on
0	has better heat transference ,  cheaper ,  and looks and feels more durable
0	did not stay together well and was advertised that it folds and did not fold ,  sent back
0	linksys num_num port switch num_extend ver num_extend arrived fast in new shrink wrapped box from beach camera through amazon
0	i only successful used it to remove two hairs  took num_num minutes  ,  which eventually grew back the next month
0	i gave it one star because we don t have a zero star option
0	the cover is supposed to slide down inside the measure cup
0	my friend swears by this nail polish and says it makes her nails hard and therefore able to grow
0	i think i could have gotten the same results with aluminum foil
0	i thought this looked really cool in pictures
0	at least i can go to my local walmart and buy it ! 
0	but i seem to be a little bit sensitive to num_extend and apparently i m not the only one
0	you have to cut the cord in half
0	these are bright bags with wacky prints on them
0	all i remember is that it was thick and highly nappy
0	they re also made in china now ,  which i don t like
0	it doesn t state artificial flavorings in the ingredients list on amazon     but they are listed on the box
0	i got a large eye screw ,  installed it in wall opposite toilet with large sail boat rope
0	becareful ,  it seemed to calm me down just a tiny bit
0	the aftertaste is just way too herbal ,  grassy tasting for me
0	so most of the calories is coming from sugar and fat
0	they are using limited activations to prevent second hand sales and to limit the lifetime of the game
0	i went to a jewelry store ,  got a cloth and got the blue off as well as the tarnish
0	but the illumination does not turn on at the desired time
0	only after i downloaded the detailed instructions from their website was i able to get it to work properly
0	cat is not a huge fan and i really got sick of stepping on them because it hurt
0	i m far from stupid but some of the puzzles just aren t at all obvious
0	my original cuisinart is num_num years old and still working well
0	i am not impressed i didn t notice any change in symptoms or discomforts related to prostate issues
0	instead of a lovely golden yellow ,  it is the light brown of a beef or vegetable broth
0	first ,  the sticker on the original cable is perfectly sized and fits in the little mold that it has
0	battle : like its predecessors ,  this star ocean has a relatively active battle system among the pantheon of rpgs
0	i thought at first it was reading celcius but that didn t work either
0	i had fun with it ,  although it does not merit it s price tag as is
0	legitimate game companies don t need to resort to cheap tricks like that
0	this compression support elastic knee does not provide any knee support
0	if you get this keep it away from the hot pan if you are not currently flipping a pancake
0	i thought my dog would love this assortment ,  but he basically is turning his nose up at it
0	it is very hard to get a regular potato through as well
0	seller did an excellent job and sent the headset right away
0	no more knives or forks stuck in to do this !  i love that it will defrost frozen bread
0	you can t change from num_extend to num_extend person
0	i really wanted this stuff to be as good as the infomercials say it is
0	i ve used marble runs from other manufacturers and have not experienced this level of poor design
0	if we d used the standard strips with the two lines we d have an answer avoid computerized tests like this
0	this put a pretty good blade on my kitchen knife set  calphalon  the first few times i used it
0	i returned this !  i could not adjust it all
0	it s all peach ,  i don t taste any tea
0	the cost to make one is probably num_num cents
0	yet my hand seems too small to fit over the ball and push the buttons
0	they never really liked this thing even though it gives my two big fat rats more room
0	right there on the front ,  in the king s english and everything
0	but for me ,  i have to have a pleasant taste and this drink does not have it
0	i did not get that ,  but the sticker on the tine says it was with handle
0	i found the camera to be quite good ,  though i never used any video features
0	i would say please don t buy this product
0	this unit worked great for about a week
0	no power at all no matter what angle
0	the flour being enriched would not provide the nutritional value of whole wheat
0	this foundation did not even out my skin tone whatsoever
0	if you want to get rid of hair ,  try waxing
0	it happened so many times that accidental pressing of multifunction button redials last number
0	it is probably a perfect item for someone who likes quick ,  weak coffee one cup at a time
0	bought this to replaced a scoop made in num_extend
0	but the pain relief ,  for me at least ,  has been minimal
0	i love first person shooters ,  i ve played tons of them making me wonder why this game is so praised
0	if you use enough to get your solution to jell ,  the texture is poor and rubbery
0	i would get the bigger version of this product and not waste your time on these little darts
0	after a week ,  i called for a status
0	so far i have found mac concealer to be the best in terms of coverage and looking natural
0	long spiral waves are pretty on a teenage girl
0	or just over   not going up to about just below my knees
0	the dogs were playing tug of war with it their favorite game  and it started bending and breaking apart
0	the case is big and has lots of room; everything else is bad news
0	this means that when cooking steam will condense there and oils from food will also collect there
0	the changing lights are definitely adding to the novelty
0	i liked it at first ,  but the bearings failed after one year of light use
0	it has a nice wood smell ,  is super absorbent ,  and is easy to clean up
0	this game is stupid ! don t evem think about buying this item ! 
0	so thats my only complaint for a $ case
0	i bought this pan because it was rated pretty good ,  but trust me this pan is garbage
0	customer service from this company is also very poor
0	had to continuously reboot router due to lost signals; customer support useless
0	it is cheaper to buy another cable than it would be to ship the defective one back
0	this is a great skillet ,  especially for the price
0	i used it for a while although it unfortunately necessitates removing my num_extend from its speck case
0	finer tastes however will reject this stuff ,  i think because it has little cheese
0	and it was very unlikely to shatter if dropped
0	way to much !  the hearts are ugly and i was just unhappy
0	they went on fine ,  but i wouldn t buy them again
0	this thing must be on the slow boat from china
0	not happy and therefore i cannot recommend this bra
0	there s a lot of work to be done
0	i have a very hard time understanding where the ball is supposed to go
0	it was very flimsy as well ,  and didn t work
0	it also  basically from day num_extend always seemed to smell like burning rubber
0	would not recommend this product if you expect it to fly
0	the armored core series has had a rusty life the last few years
0	i didn t know about the warning until the next day
0	this is a rather pathetic rainbow that doesn t work very well
0	i cant hit the target in num_num yard after intalled this item
0	i m glad this works for some people ,  but it was worthless to me
0	the pills just make it a little easier to stick to the diet ! 
0	i called kodak and was advised to download their new software
0	this trash tastes like cardboard packaging ,  and sugar and vitamin c added ?  i am sorry ,  that is not %
0	was taking product and i had to stop ,  as my stomach was very upset after using it
0	this product is made of very stiff material and has a very small opening to fill and empty it
0	i cleaned it as directed ,  waited for the green light and poured in the batter
0	since moving to the country ,  we ve had a problem with clothes moths
0	even when i push the ball ,  can t get much speed
0	this is one of marvel s more pathetic attempts at a video game
0	i would not recommend these for who would find those issues to be deal breakers
0	i may have to cut them off my rims
0	i pushed the pin back in and the clip is working
0	although they liked it ,  it did not fitmy standards or liking
0	so don t think the mouse patch makes this game playable also ,  the graphics in the pc version are unbelievably bad
0	i know many people swear by this product ,  but i think it is a crappy product
0	this tire has  kevlar  in it ?  yeah ,  right
0	i m not even remotely impressed with the chatter phone
0	the sound quality is pretty good ,  but these headphones are not loud
0	i took this on chance that it d help with some bruises i suffered from workout injuries
0	i m a fan of the rts genre in general
0	i thought these would be great give her a little traction and keep her from licking
0	i d love to protect my screens but this isn t the way to do it
0	but these are pretty bad ,  have purplish tent on the lenses
0	and maybe they ll get there if they haven t already
0	buyer needs to beware of the expiration date on the product
0	i normally purchase the smaller can of evo ,  but the % my cats would not touch
0	save your time and money ,  order them from somebody else
0	uses the remote ,  and shuts off you ll probably never have a problem
0	that s very accurate and i wish i d paid more attention to that feedback
0	even adjusted to the smallest configuration ,  they are still too big for me
0	the clips on the edges do not fit ,  do not clip ,  it falls apart
0	this did not work well for us at all
0	i should have followed suit but this was a little cheaper
0	the fact that this had baking soda in it really means nothing
0	vibes are not strong so if looking for strong vibes that is not your cup of tea
0	i am thinking maybe keep it in the fridge would be better
0	the sound actually almost sounds as if it came from the console versions
0	unfortunatley my cat does not seem to mind
0	it s not hurting my face ,  but it s not making it better either
0	you drive around to the bad guy and subdue him or kill him
0	maybe i got a defective one ,  but the bag i received was not num_num degrees
0	i bought these mitts for the high reviews but i was insanely disappointed
0	quite frankly the quality of the character models seems of a good dreamcast game ,  or a poor num_extend game
0	first ,  the device should come with an axilliary hook for hanging it
0	it has found a permanent home on my dash but
0	cashed in my chips and called it quits on the sony
0	i started with a $ krups blade grinder ,  it didn t do the job
0	dark sector s story is boring don t even spend the money renting the game
0	the quilted lining is thin and pretty minimal
0	you could actually get online and see things people would do and it made it all the more entertaining
0	the second was the same and just quit working after a few weeks
0	i have in and went to the the verision store and bought one that actually works
0	they leak ground spices out of every pore so if possible stick to using them for larger leafy spices
0	i heard they were made in spain ,  however i received a unit which was made in china
0	the second time there was a mess and the clock would not work when i replaced the batteries
0	i have an old watch which sits on the table about num_num feet from me
0	if you want this to just protect your lighter ,  then its perfect
0	the handle doesn t stay upright ,  so the child has to be a good walker to use it
0	i would still only give it about num_num stars though
0	the num_extend i bought doesn t work properly with my omnibook num_extend
0	the cables in almost all of these have cracked
0	i thought i would get this and carry her in it when she became fatigued
0	it will lighten it even more than that ,  if you can get it all the way through your hair
0	it only takes a few times before they fail
0	the shoulders stick out several inches past the hole where the arm sticks out
0	i had ordered this face cream along with the hand cream and the smell made me sick
0	this brush was defective out of the box
0	there must be a better clipper out there and i ll keep looking
0	you can barely tell what element something is or anything else
0	i was doing all these things while waiting on hold
0	i connected it to three devices and it did not work
0	within a couple of days all it did was click
0	it also stretches ,  which makes it hard to wear in tighter shoes
0	it would do this with all the coins
0	the num_num degree turn will works better as the waste water does not rush directly to the hose seal
0	i finished the entire bottle anyway but the symptoms did not improve
0	you have to fly for minutes to find a enemy ,  and then you have to find nine more
0	taste is king ,  then as long as the flavor pops ,  i look for licorice that is as natural  i e
0	this is one of the most overrated games of the mario series
0	i replaced the bulbs with the original led s i had installed and will avoid this vendor in the future
0	this compared to the old pointy apple corer forget this one
0	i disagree with the other haribo fans on this product page
0	in my mind ,  i m owed this as i ve paid for it
0	i have to wonder about safety as some do ,  with all the other deception attached to these things
0	the person that i was speaking with complained about the clarity of my voice
0	graphic is good but not spectacular considering the game being a resource hog
0	well the taste is very salty and extremely bitter
0	again ,  xbox owners get leftovers from a num_extend ported num_extend
0	because this doesn t even seem like crayola quality
0	the next time i tried to check ,  the phone wouldn t even power on be warned :  do not buy this product
0	i feel sorry that i purchased this case it s cheap ,  and you have to build it yourself
0	must be afull small feet this is a very frustrating device
0	all i can sa at this point ,  try at you own risk
0	if the plastic casing piece fit i would rate this a ten plus
0	this product does not work for me compared to other cla products that have tonalin on the label
0	if you read my other reviews ,  i have given mostly positive
0	does not work as well as cheap hot filter from w a l m a r t
0	it doesn t smell horrible ,  but it has a smokey smell to it
0	i am pretty disappointed with this purchase ,  and will be keeping my eye out for better products
0	mine was missing the left channel when new from the package
0	it left me more thirsty than when i finished it overall not very good
0	some of the speech is still in japanese ,  which is pretty lame they didn t bother to translate it
0	i have been taking the regular mucinex for years whenever i need it with great success
0	does not last long ,  and didn t change my cats  behaviors at all
0	although i have yet to test the sound isolation capability ,  i m really disappointed with its overall sound quality
0	this listing has changed drastically since i ordered mine num_num years ago
0	the red rivets on the zipper fall out of the case
0	i could not cut a single square inch on my back
0	i prefer a stylus that feels more like a pen in my hand
0	this review is for the net wash plus ,  not the actual neti pot
0	the snap closure on this collar is a little too easy to open
0	i ve owned almost every system that has come out ,  and been happy with most of them
0	case did not align up with my samsung num_extend very flexible and cheap
0	there are much sturdier walkers out there and also equipped with better activities than this one ! 
0	figured i would then put the rest in my wife s accord
0	i received them all scratched up and they didn t last long before cracking
0	when i turned on the computer it went crazy and burned out the motherboard
0	these are much smaller hence do not fully encompass your ears
0	you shoot and miss ,  and shoot and miss and so on
0	perhaps this is an acquired skill ,  but i can t get the planes to do anything for me
0	thanks amazon readers for posting your helpful information
0	it was rather cheap ,  i ended up giving it away because it was cheaply made ! 
0	this product flaked off of my nails within hours of application
0	the first two that came were absolutely filthy ,  having grease marks all over the edges
0	i purchased in store and ended up returning the product
0	i ve tried every type of head and shoulders to help and none work
0	it also burns pretty bad if you apply it after shaving
0	the fist one was doa right out of the package
0	also beware it only takes num_num bb s at a time
0	i only wear them around the house because of the wrinkling bull crap
0	i took this supplement for about num_num days ,  then had pain in the upper right side of my abdomen
0	if i had been the one purchasing this for christmas ,  i would have done way more research
0	don t bother buying this vacuum your better off with a broom
0	i was almost going to break my phone trying to remove case
0	i would have to bend the cable to make the sound work
0	you can t just plug one adapter in to something else
0	given that leather is a great selling point ,  it s hard to believe that this would not be printed somewhere
0	i would change it to num_num if it were possible
0	i ordered the correct size ,  sports bras are supposed to be somewhat tight
0	also i am plagued by not being able to use my hands very well
0	more like watch some stuff ,  play a little ,  watch more ,  play a little
0	these are the worst thing i have ever gotten from amazon
0	if you are a novice gamer ,  you will get bored with this game
0	now they wanted almost $ to fix it
0	i bought it a sephora so i paid $ instead of the better price here
0	unfortunately ,  this title has that rushed to deadline feel to it and it shows
0	i bought two because i have two cats
0	now it s broken for the third time after having just been repaired num_num months ago
0	the qb ,  when he steps back and throws the ball to the right ,  his arm slings left
0	there s a ton on the butt though ,  and i don t sit back that far on a road bike
0	i would ve shipped it back i lost the packaging and just wrote it off as loss
0	only the die hard star wars fans would pick this up
0	it was just plainly so uncomforatble that i stopped using it
0	see review on the chews for petite dogs
0	i love mocha icecream and thought i d love this cafe late bar
0	then adding the black pepper makes it even worse
0	i love green tea ,  i love pomegranate ,  and i love flavored teas
0	but even at this low price ,  a cable should last more than num_num months
0	too bad ,  it fits my phone nicely and is great protection
0	this one is sturdier ,  but since it s not effective for my needs ,  that doesn t help me
0	i`m not sure if i keep it ,  i didn`t want a regular golden color
0	you can go to notre dame and num_extend chicago  a perfect dark reference ?   right next to each other
0	it relieved the pressure of a nodule more than anything ,  which was helpful
0	i d opt for a grinder with rave reviews
0	this case is just too flimsy to case a $ phone
0	this wax seems to shine my black car quite nicely
0	they obviously have no experience or business being in the pci card realm
0	however ,  he s willing to test the model himself and try to get a solution
0	the real ones are really bright without having to charge in the sun
0	i like knorr products and have used them for many years
0	i travel a lot by motorcycle ,  camping half the time
0	i bought this collection for galaga num_extend alone
0	i was very disappointed even if the music would have great quality ,  i m not sure i d like it much better
0	this screen cover does not adhere to the face of the phone well enough to be useful
0	i am hoping i can give them to a friend or to a rescue group
0	it literally took me num_num hours just to do that battle
0	my carver sunfire center channel speaker over powers these speakers with ease
0	no matter how much praise or how many treats i stuff in their face
0	it is that poor tasting i know i will never buy it again
0	i don t like thick sleeves that bunch at the elbow while i m driving
0	it took num_num weeks of non use for the itching and swelling to completely go away
0	my next test was to chop my salsa
0	always remember that  natural  and even some  organic  standards depend on how these standards impact profitability
0	you are an edf trooper protecting the world from an alien invasion
0	i was very disappointed with mix num_num in the berry formula
0	every decent strategy game out there ships with multiplayer   you shouldn t charge more later for what should be included
0	even my last year s camera was much better than this num_extend
0	feels like its going to break any minute
0	compared to stevita ,  the better stevia packets don t dissolve in cold drinks easily
0	had to return it because it was impossible to get the time right
0	i use end frequently and it should not have been moved
0	i wouldn t say that the controls are that good ,  though
0	very thin ,  thin weave that you can see through if you hold it up to light
0	they are low in fiber ,  with a mere num_num gram ,  and contain num_num grams of carbohydrate
0	does not make a noticable enough difference in sound quality to justify it s cost
0	i ve been using this product effectively for about ten years
0	the shoes do not have enough ventilation for heat fifth problem
0	the cables pull the door s  up and hold the doors open
0	as soon as i saw the packaging for this product ,  i was skeptical

0	the old pinch collars also just work so much better
0	i was unable to install tge setpoint software that come on the enclosed cd
0	just wanted to go on record as yet another person who is disappointed with this  new  formula
0	the shirt is fine if you like red and with a sateen shine it is exactly as it is advertised !  ! 
0	kinda as if it had been stretched out
0	it s still only compatible with vista  i hated vista  and xp
0	i m shelving it and will update my review once it s fixed enough to play
0	so i ve been going tanning for about a month and a half now using this product
0	i tried this scratcher for my inside only cat and my outside only cat
0	do some research and you will see that other gamers have the same complaint
0	but the gist is this company sells old dead batteries ,  so you probably want to look elsewhere
0	nintendo next year will release their new gamecube
0	not everybody is going to dish out thousands of dollars for an ampliphier or some stereo
0	i usually swear by this stuff so as i said
0	it may work somewhat ,  but i can t handle the greasy feeling on my skin
0	he would pee in the toilet with no problems but this cat takes some pride with his poop
0	just recently got these and let me tell you
0	it almost never worked for my dog  an australian shepherd 
0	even the box for the gopicnic was bulkier then need be
0	this is after i already called our isp to reboot the modem
0	the other pine tar soaps i bought didn t bother me like this one did
0	this holster is very cheap and the plastic clips that holds the phone in place breaks easily
0	spreading it on your bacon is the meat lovers equivalent of the popular chocolate donut with chocolate icing
0	they are not the kind of girls that put there toys on a shelf and leave them there
0	i returned it for the larger model that i like
0	within the first week the metal plates had fallen off
0	loved the colors then i go check out walmart s mainstay version of this
0	i threw the belt in the trash this morning
0	however ,  even if that hadn t been an issue ,  i still felt like this thing was a piece of junk
0	i used this product on all num_num of my pets ,  all with the same result
0	when i switched makeups ,  my face totally cleared up
0	i kept thinking i must be doing something wrong
0	do not waste you $ took me and my roommate num_num hrs to beat  :   my money wasted
0	in the picture ,  they look small ,  which would be cool
0	does it matter how good they sound if you can t keep them in your ears ? 
0	i bought these googles for my son who swims competitively
0	i purchased about num_num extra probes for the taylor unit directly from taylor by mail
0	looks fine in the picture ,  but in person it just needs more wires i think
0	avoid this productdoing research on the internet you find out this is dangerous for for use
0	i have always a spare because it s not very secure to the camera
0	how about num_num mg of sodium ?  that exceeds almost all of the common brands of tortilla chips i ve seen
0	warning :  num_num grams of sugar reminds me of the horrible orange drinks they give you for glucose tolerance test
0	now ,  i love my rice sticky but there s a difference between sticky and glumpy   this was glumpy
0	my bose bt headset just crapped out and i just bought the num_extend
0	after using it ,  my hair was still tangled and felt like it had nothing on it
0	luckily ,  i have found a cheaper alternative here on amazon that i m not allergic to
0	also ,  the spoken dialog is heard about num_num seconds prior to the character s mouths actually moving
0	most of the plastic continues to break of every time i use it
0	silly ,  silly me the one benefit of this is that it s rather simple to add to the ipad
0	so glad i didn t go to bed with it on not realizing the issue with this new formula
0	the scoll wheel is crude ,  and you can actually count the notches as you scroll
0	all is good except the outlet hole is too small it would be perfect if they made the hole bigger
0	it does a superb job of creating a creepy environment for you to play in
0	boy was i wrong !  it looks like a piece of crap once assembled
0	had this machine one day before returning it
0	i bought a $ osterizer and it s a little smaller but does ice quickly and well without problems
0	don t make the same mistake i made by purchasing this
0	here are my comments regarding each set : garnet :  too dark
0	i d pick a plan toys train set instead
0	if you notice the picture of it shows it holding a ringed binder
0	the fragrance of the so called shea butter is quite intense
0	i really wish i had seen the reviews before i purchased num_extend
0	the blade bends ,  in my opinion ,  too num_extend
0	we ran over and pulled out a large wad of threads from his mouth and throat
0	unless you have money to burn ,  i d pass this one by
0	i was surprised how bulky the gloves were ,  they looked thin and elegant online
0	omg i m so in love with this cream first off ,  the ingredient list is all natural ,  no toxic additives
0	so i just bought this based on the bb sales rep s recommendation
0	it lingers forever ,  long after you ve finished your last sip and it s not very pleasant
0	perhaps someone with bad taste will appreciate this terrible game
0	it seems to make the eyelashes soft ,  but so far not any length or thickening
0	they were dried out you can t directly control the moisture locked in the dry kernels; only the manufacturer can
0	during an average cutscene ,  the graphics look a tad choppy
0	challenge yourself to get num_num stars on every fight and it s a good action game
0	i just glued it back together ,  but it can t swivel anymore
0	this use to be a fairly good product
0	there is one more thing you should know
0	i hadn t read the ingredients until after i made it
0	i love the original mocha chip balance bars
0	i purchased this device from staples as a christmas present for my wife
0	the man i bought them for doesn t like them
0	it literally ripped off my skin ,  and left me with bruises
0	let the casual players play madden s franchise mode
0	at least they do a better job at game design
0	i got these for guppies ,  but the guppies couldn t eat them
0	then the top around my ribs it was too big
0	i bought this ball for my hyper lab and mixed terrier
0	i love herbal teas ,  and thought this was a ginger tea
0	i purchased this item because there re good review
0	i was hoping for the larger oxo handle like the paring knife
0	well ,  now it is damaged the only remaining plus for this unit is the vcr
0	my vet suggested one of these based on her assumption that my dog is anxious
0	many products contain chemicals and other ingredients that are dangerous and can cause severe allergic reactions
0	i tasted no vanilla ,  and the coffee itself was very bitter for a medium roast
0	contacted citi and they wanted me to send a picture of the cable
0	would not order this item again it does not really protect cell from breaking if dropped  :  
0	the only problem i have is the gun does not feel secure
0	this causes my feet to slide forward when i walk
0	what i do is this : i use the double fold method and put it in as the directions say to
0	a shame too ,  because it was not cheap
0	what a mess !  i m so ,  so ,  so upset with this cleaner
0	the ramp pieces just would not stay connected
0	spend the extra num_num bucks and get a real cutting board
0	we went out and spent $ and bought some clippers from our vet ,  which are much sharper
0	i bought num_num blades and am stuck for a while another gillette marketing gimmick that ,  for me ,  does not deliver
0	but lever backs don t match up so the first time i wore them i lost one shame as they are lovely
0	this should have arrived on monday the num_extend it is now the num_extend and it still has not arrived
0	it s exactly what i m looking for but no way will i pay such a criminal shipping charge
0	this does not dissolve completely even with hot water
0	i bought this to hook up a metronome to an amp
0	the first night i set them up they worked perfectly for num_num hours
0	it has a one year warrantee so this is destined for the trash  or for freecycle 
0	party is able to overthrow the emporer   yep that s about it
0	it does have a nice scent ,  which dissipates in a matter of hours
0	num_extend are very unconfortable i would not buy again them
0	hope this helps any trying this for that reason
0	this tripod is suitable for a small digital camera
0	i also bought moving comfort women s fiona bra and i love it great support
0	if your cold is cured after taking these for just two weeks ,  well ,  great i guess
0	get a separate pasta machine ,  the stainless steel kind that breaks the pasta down into sheets of thickness
0	worse than the one that was in the phone
0	drm concerns and stability issues  again  to name a couple of issues
0	after my logitec mouse died from abuse ,  i was looking for a comfortable precise mouse
0	i am an avid coffee drinker ,  and i use this pot everyday
0	i immediately contacted adorama and requested a refund and paid return shipping as well as the correct product
0	this dog food contains mostly corn and disgusting animal digest  slaughter house scraps like hooves ,  hair ,  feathers ,  etc 
0	i boughta replacement batteryand installed it ,  then charged it up
0	the other doll s hands are super flexible andso are the legs but without a chance of breaking
0	after washing and drying ,  i held the shirt next to one of my medium hanes  longsleeve pullovers
0	i am hungry and i can not open any cans
0	then again ,  i have serious sleep problems and have kind of surpassed a lot of natural remedies
0	glad amazon has such great shipping and return policies
0	whoever said  not only is it not vegetable soup ,  it s not even soup  was perfectly right
0	tested it against two others and it always showed the plant as being more wet than it really was
0	i grind my own beans and try as often as possible to purchase fairly traded beans
0	we submitted for a return and have switched to another brand
0	when the vehicle is flipped ,  the controllers control the same wheels ,  but the wheel positions are reversed
0	this causes the contents to loose potency almost immediately
0	when it comes to wrinkles ,  well more aggressive procedures need to be applied
0	i m a huge star wars fan ,  and i pretty much have ever game with star wars in the title
0	i hate using drugs but in this case it is worth it
0	he wore them on the weekends to break them in but that didn t work
0	i tried these based on the reviews and they were very stiff ,  plastic feeling and generally uncomfortable
0	or ,  you will find yourself trying to baste quickly ,  before it runs out of the tube
0	it is very cheap looking and not worth the price
0	so obviously i never got to use it ,  but i was unimpressed with the overall quality
0	my other teapots with infuser baskers don t have this problem
0	the older ones had battery covers that would not stay on however
0	when i attempted to pull them farther up my waist to find more room ,  i received an instant wedgie
0	i have already replaced the purse and would not recommend it
0	they do not even pass the most cursory visual comparison to a genuine motorola battery
0	num_extend +  it still does not seem as strong as the young living
0	too much effort for a one week solution
0	rent it and find out for yourself ,  but save your pocketbook some cash
0	may as well just press the button on the itouch to change tracks
0	the next num_num or num_num levels were the same
0	but at this price you would think the packaging would be better
0	the bottle says to apply over three   !   coats of base coat
0	my way of hitting is to just swing and see what happens
0	i don t really like the taste of this compared to sugar
0	it needs to be a whole lot num_extend
0	i found it hard to peel off the individual paper wrappers without leaving bits of candy stuck to them
0	aren t i supposed to be in the same base as gordon freeman ?  oh wait ,  i guess i am
0	no ,  i would not recommend ,  and yeah ,  the panties are bikinis and show threw your clothes
0	i wanted to see mars and a good look at the rings of saturn
0	the size xl runs too small  more like a l 
0	cushioning ,  is hard and it took only few seconds to begin hurting my ears
0	i have wanted this mixer for probably num_num years now
0	it didn t detox me like it claims it supposed to do
0	i used a sharpie and traced the outside holes onto the the inside section
0	that in itself was weird since i have never used a body wash like that
0	anyway ,  after using num_num screen protectors ,  i had to accept my fate
0	the product was difficult to install and did not cover the corners of my phone
0	first it has a light grayish color to it
0	the list includes this item as well as the others listed
0	i know nothing pushed on the reset button
0	but the fm reception is so bad that this radio is worthy of only num_num stars
0	i wish the device had come with some kind of instructions or support
0	they are over a month old ,  and i will probably just wash them down the drain
0	basically they seem to be crispy green peas
0	since when did they stop sealing ?  the top seemed to be on snug but obviously it wasn t
0	so i ordered this style in the same size
0	i picked up an old stereo receiver for $
0	i would skip this and just use the controller
0	that said ,  the gun has a lot of nice features
0	needless to say i am still buying pam spray
0	they are still wearable ,  but i really only put them on if my other two pairs are dirty
0	i would save your money and get something without any moving parts
0	the eyes at the top can close and clip baby while they re playing with it
0	upon putting the case on my phone ,  it snapped the power button out
0	would notrecommend unless you keep out of sun
0	it s too bad they did look like nice speakers ,  a little big ,  but well made
0	the sleeve for the nano split num_num seconds into sliding it on
0	this bra has this weird extra nipple room that i did not need
0	i got the brown and it is truly the most unattractive color ever
0	i have been on and off dying and getting professional highlights for years
0	the metal they used tastes bad like they used old tin cans or something ,  and they were flimsy
0	maybe something that expanded when wet or was thick enough to do the job with just one
0	they don t stretch around the band and are consequently very uncomfortable
0	the colors are also very hard to blend
0	i think using a tinted moisturizer is easier to use then this stuff
0	now i see why so many people complained bitterly about these treatments all of the brands
0	everything echoes for some reason when you go down hills of streets {shrug}
0	they slip off just like normal bobby pins
0	i bought it when it first came out and realized that the num_extend price tag was way over priced
0	my former frother lasted some num_num years before i wore it out
0	partition magic  if the problem is with the bios  and not the os  then upgrade the bios
0	i ve been using the product for almost num_num months now
0	i can t even get more than halfway through the first training mission without the game crashing
0	this food has truly been an awful experience and i will not be buying anymore
0	its sad since they used to be my go to company
0	i ordered these after reading the ingredient list posted by amazon and concluding they were vegan
0	i think oxo should stick to extrusion plastic goods and stay away from wood products
0	i purchased this phone from the best buy website
0	one strand has already unraveled this has been reviewed after one week of use
0	i did do alot of research on this coffee pot and thought the  overflow  issue wouldn t happen to me
0	rogue squadon is somewhat fun to play but the majority of the missions are hard to beat
0	i would rather do without coffee than to drink this
0	it s quite fun to try and match the songs to the characters
0	i understand that the num_extend is aging hardware ,  but i ve seen some damn beautiful games run perfectly on it
0	when i went to pull the tab to remove the phone ,  nothing happened
0	still no one could hear me talking and what they did hear sounded like an echo
0	i have had this product for approximately num_num years
0	downfall was that the cable only worked for a couple weeks then it completely before it stopped completely
0	overall ,  a disappointing purchase that i wouldn t recommend
0	although i bought these pedals along with mountain bike cycling shoes ,  the fit was poor
0	i found my skin was sensitive and it darken my skin a l
0	the mat should be connected to earth ground or placed on a grounded surface
0	besides the deadweight allies ,  the difficulty curve for this game is broken
0	i like that is is very easy to clean and fill
0	unfortunately it s a spell ,  so you have to spend mana on it
0	when one turns off the unit ,  it forgets where it was playing
0	then ,  as others have mentioned ,  the temperature dial started sticking
0	they re also about $ cheaper than the ctc lasers i do not work for  or against  either company
0	this product did not work well at all
0	not even one month ,  it was borken already ,  and i don t really use it that often
0	you can t move your phone from vertical to horizontal position without using both hands
0	if you have an average sized forearm ,  you shouldn t have a problem
0	the eye relief is still num_num and i must take my glasses off
0	does not work kind of sad it didnt though ,  still have half a bottle left
0	and i guess all of you too    after all  ,  i dont think that the toxic cyanid
0	it is the loudest ,  most obnoxious sound you ll ever num_extend
0	the gameshark intercooler would get a num_num star rating ,  because it works as advertised
0	and the lid covering the grinding chamber is screwed on so no more leaky mess
0	the cursor doesn t always respond well ,  and is very frustrating
0	for the life of me ,  i can t see why this game got so many great reviews
0	i opened it up and was very surprised at how cheap the attachments were
0	i have two now ,  because ihave one for each cat
0	i do not recommend this product for any reason
0	linksys tech support can t offer any solutions that you can t read off their website
0	no accommodation has been made for the extra attachment
0	i had to shell out money for a facial with extractions to clear everything out
0	it still didn t work  live and learn ,  i guess
0	it s their poor design and not the store s fault who sold it
0	the reason i bought this was the heart rate function
0	the back of the heel is too low and the shoe easily slips off at the back
0	way too much money for the quality that it is
0	you never quite can get things done rapidly enough in or out of battle
0	buying from amazon was not the best choice in saving money
0	i really didn t want the money and just wanted the unit replaced
0	i ordered the motorola roadster num_num after owning the original num_extend motorola hands free car speakerphone for several years
0	you press different buttons on your controller in different combinations to perform your tasks
0	i just received my brand new uncle mike s deluxe range bag today
0	even while i m trying to put this game together it s falling apart
0	i tried to take it apart ,  but you can t without breaking it
0	i chose to sell it instead of starting over again
0	they don t break well and don t seem to have a high value for the dogs
0	i finally found a food that does not cause gas
0	so if you are looking for something protective i wouldn t recommend this case
0	every time one of these dialogue sequences comes up ,  there s loading
0	just glad that my larger dogs didn t get hold of it because it could be a definite choking hazard ! 
0	the frog in this picture is cute ,  right ?  the one we got
0	in short ,  buyer beware ,  make sure if you purchase it its from a reputable amazon retailer
0	the only really useful thing is that it has hooks to hang your tools
0	i can wear this when gardening but won t be able to wear it in yoga which was its purpose
0	this product works great as long as you go under num_extend in your car
0	not what the palete is expecting when it thinks it is getting strawberry
0	i may try putting my own suction cup on it
0	as soon as i flipped it over ,  i saw the cracks in the bottom
0	that was unplesantsecond ,  they taste nothing like pomegranate
0	i bought this ring and it is the perfect size and the ring is shiny at first
0	if your tastes are like mine ,  try the kopiko coffee candy
0	in some ways this is the best num_extend recorder i ve used
0	i wanted to but avatar the burning earth but instead i bought this one by mistake
0	in fact it broke after num_num months of use
0	.   busy i love final fantasy games ,  and i also love mmorpgs
0	my third just died after six weeks of daily use
0	i found this product to be very clumpy and gloopy and smudge
0	there s a few bits of gunk trapped here and there ,  but nothing impressive
0	at first ,  i was impressed with this product ,  natural etc  ,  etc
0	so the time on my router is off by one hour for six months of the year
0	this purchase was not as i had expected
0	i had great hopes for this collar ,  since it was a perfect size for my num_extend
0	but that was the first bag we bought
0	even then ,  the signal was weak and the sound quality was horrible
0	vegetable volley  series num_extend  japanese :  bulldoze your way through num_extend
0	i tried i tried i tried some more this did nothing at all to my scar nothing
0	i used this on the new num_extend phone with bluetooth num_extend
0	i bought this tea on a whim thinking it would be perfect for this autumn and winter
0	i didn t have it long and the clear bubble top broke when washing
0	indent is not solid or high enough ,  imho ,  to hold iphone carefully enough
0	an insult to the state of texas ,  chili ,  and your intelligence
0	i ordered this bra in a num_num f which is normally my size
0	when plugged in it had to be kept completely motionless
0	we tried the various tips the headset came with ,  tried readjusting it ,  etc
0	don t waste your money and just buy something else
0	each time i would try to viev a movie from my camera ,  the laptop would shut down
0	the greenworks model will do the job ,  but not comfortably ,  or as well
0	i would not buy again even at the sale price
0	those aren t as neat as the worlds in super mario bros
0	the underwire was too stiff and felt like it was digging into me
0	whether you ll like the scent is another matter
0	even with a lock on it ,  i am still weary of it opening up
0	i ve purchased it three times and each tube has lasted less than a month
0	as soon as i opened the package i knew i made a mistake; this is a piece of junk
0	the other side of the slice toasted in a striped pattern but the bottom was still white
0	sound quality was great if you like static   cause that is all i heard
0	for the price ,  i expected a little better
0	they are supposed to be neutral and protective but instead they distort
0	at night ,  it looked like there were ufo s behind me
0	the original knife has s slight hollow bevel while the new knife is a low performance straight ground edge
0	the quality is very poor and the pink color is not at all the one shown on the picture
0	it was not relaxing to us at all
0	my wife s has held up fine but she hardly uses her phone
0	they avoid it at all costs ,  and only eat it when finally they give in to their hunger
0	amazon gave me the choice to return it or sell it to someone else
0	i took a recommendation from somebody to try out these lozenges
0	unfortunately ,  these peacock brand noodles are yet another food masquerading as healthy
0	purified water with out minerals will also prevent any mineral deposits to collect on the screen
0	layed a towel down in the bathroom and went to work
0	it has a problem playing unless you put a headphone jack in the receptacle ,  just exactly right
0	i think the openings are too small to really let them swat at the ball
0	i buy this product locally all the time at one of the big pet stores
0	i cannot use this item and neither can i recommend this to a friend
0	i didn t like the taste ,  it s ramen instead of udon ,  and it s just not very good
0	it may work if you have a different phone or model
0	though i used it for a while ,  it was definetely not what i expected
0	it is a great concept ,  but it doesn t work like the bird
0	i tried to like this cream and it was not working
0	i can t even get the usb driver for the device to install on any of my systems
0	you won t find a single mob in this game it seems
0	loved it ,  couldn t get bored or enough of it ,  chasing my dragon of num_extend multiplayer
0	the only one of my gadgets it seems to reliably charge is my old kindle
0	this game is annoying ,  it will tick you off
0	it has sugar in it !  awful ,  awful ,  awful
0	first ,  the esrb rating system should either be trashed or severely reformed
0	another major downfall is always having a darn yankee on the cover
0	so i tossed out all the remaining vitamins to the trash can
0	also ,  you do not get the lightening bolt on the battery icon to indicate that it is charging
0	frankly ,  after num_num weeks of use ,  i could not tell if it worked or not
0	the shaver now quits when there is num_num bars left
0	the tops dug into my legs and i had to cut them and fix them
0	we live on a hill and when used the containment area fluctuated
0	please don t go threw the heartache i just went threw
0	i contacted customer service over the course of num_num times
0	hate the remote after num_num years ,  mine finally broke for good
0	i ordered num_num eneloop aa batteries supposedly pre charged and slow to discharge
0	so instead i had to skip dinner and wash it out
0	why not use stainless steel strainers in all their units ? 
0	you want to make hash browns its better to grate them by hand
0	the stuff i got is in a plastic container ,  not really breakable ,  so the package is in excellent condition
0	plug the device s bulky power adapter in and press the button ,  and wait
0	the product arrived in its original case with game booklet
0	couldn t use as styling cream too heavy ,  good for a beach day or vaca@south beach
0	also in the drawer are many ,  many inexpensive pairs purchased at place s like bps and gander mountain
0	second ,  the sides of my small toes were hurting as well ,  both feet ,  by afternoon
0	with so many new things just around the corner  think crysis  it is difficult to justify a purchase here
0	our dog ignored the toy and wouldn t eat the treats
0	on one hand ,  it cooks rice quick  under num_num min  and the rice comes out really good
0	also ,  the warriors look like monkeys in a colorful spacesuit !  i suggest you buy some other game ! 
0	luckily we bought it locally and where able to bring it back
0	it bunches up i purchase another one on the internet manufactured by universal surgical
0	you will need to use this a lot of you want to listen to the music on your phone
0	most were almost like new while only a couple cards appeared very used
0	i thought it was going to be a nice light beverage like herbal tea
0	i have a premonition that this door is going to dictate the life of this num_extend
0	the cable comes in from the outside and then is split two ways
0	at first i thought it was due to him getting bored of the food
0	it is a clever design with a swivel head ,  but poorly designed
0	i had this monitor for about a year and half
0	they almost look like they re stretching sometimes almost
0	the i got into the menu and changed some things visually
0	now it s no longer a great deal on quality toilet paper
0	but this stuff did not work right and cost nearly as much as the real stuff does
0	working at a bodyshop i have to have winter boots that can withstand the elements
0	bionocular has marginal optics ,  but its only $
0	they sent a num_extend which is supposed to be even better with num_num hours talk time
0	ordered a pair of these for my num_num year old
0	i can t recommend this to anyone looking to eat a hearty breakfast
0	miserable little thing died after being used twice
0	the phone does a factory reset and you lose all info  ,  apps and documents
0	after hanging up with verizon with no luck ,  my husband was thinking maybe it s the case
0	my bike was locked right outside my door to a metal railing with this lock
0	don t know if the upgrade had an effect ,  but the router never worked well after that
0	ever since then ,  i ve always opted for colombian coffee because of the rich flavor i got out of yuban
0	if you are looking for a decent carpet shampooer ,  then this is a good buy
0	we would get out of the box and seek a place with more room to stretch
0	i tried to find a chain in my jewelry box to put this on to no avail
0	i m also plagued by sensitive skin and break out with nearly every hair product i try
0	replaced the batteries and upon using the lcd screen the camera immediately told me the batteries were low
0	hope you like backtracking cause you ll be doing that allot in this one
0	i have owned several shavers over the years
0	for me it was a waste of money
0	don t know if its salicylic acid itself or if its the company s formulation
0	it used to be the best wax on the market ,  they must have changed the ingredients
0	then as i was removing the product the pain began in other fingers on both hands
0	there was no way these would be wearable for a day at the office
0	unlike others ,  i don t think it s an earth shattering design
0	park told me to buy a professional wrench if it is used often to remove pedals that were overtighted
0	there is little i can say that won t duplicate what others have said
0	amazon should take this product out of its site
0	they even came out way before this dud
0	the price isn t bad for what it gives
0	the self clean indicator is a joke i would suggest that anyone looking at this expensive model ,  look elsewhere
0	this is just an example of sega cashing in on the wii hype back than
0	that s about it however i would also look at other reviews
0	it s super cheap and fits very loosely on my car air vent
0	the chips themselves are ok ,  without a reliable way to transport them this poker set isn t worth much
0	i researched bluetooth s and this one was supposed to be the best ,  what a joke
0	too bad we bought it when it first came out
0	especially when the really good variety is available
0	and so far i tried twice but it doesnt really show any color on my face
0	i was first very disappointed by the smell
0	i have two of these ,  and my kids do not like wearing them
0	that means debris from whatever you re using them for will fall into the palm area
